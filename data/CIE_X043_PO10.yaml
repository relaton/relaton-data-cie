abstract:
- content: The objective of the present series of experiments was to estimate discrimination
    surfaces in 3-D colour space for simulated images of human skin under three illumination
    conditions - dark, simulated daylight or D65 and cool-white-fluorescent or TL84.
    Representative patches from two ethnicities - Caucasian and Oriental, were used.
    Our findings suggest that human observers are better at discriminating small differences
    in simulated skin under simulated daylight, and that this difference in performance
    is dominated by the change in thresholds along the luminance direction. The purely
    chromatic discrimination boundaries (chromatic ellipses) do not change in area
    between simulated daylight and artificial fluorescent light.
