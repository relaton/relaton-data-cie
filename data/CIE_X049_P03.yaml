abstract:
- content: We evaluated several data acquisition systems for measurement of temporal
    light modulations. A waveform generator was used to simulate temporal light modulation
    waveforms for this evaluation. The generated waveform was used as the waveform
    reference and was measured using three representative data acquisition systems
    with resolutions of 24 bits, 16 bits, and 8 bits. The temporal light artefacts
    quantities, the short-term flicker index, PstLM, perception modulation, Mp, and
    stroboscopic effect visibility measure, SVM, of the reference waveform and three
    measured waveforms were calculated and compared.
