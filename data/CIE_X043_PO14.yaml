abstract:
- content: We performed 3 independent spectroradiometric measurements of the 9 colour
    pairs in the grey scale of the Society of Dyers and Colourist (SDC) at 6 different
    viewing angles, as provided by a byko-spectra multi-angle colour assessment cabinet.
    On the average, the CIELAB colour differences of these colour pairs showed a variability
    with viewing angle 4 times higher than the variability associated to the 3 independent
    measurements. BRDF measurements of the samples in the SDC grey scale confirmed
    their goniochromatism, which is not identical to the one shown by the samples
    in the grey scale of the American Association of Textiles Chemists and Colorists
    (AATCC). A pseudo-divergence bidimensional representation confirmed the results
    found for the two grey scales. We conclude that the viewing angle is a relevant
    parameter in the colour differences of colour pairs of commercial grey scales
    placed in multi-angle colour cabinets.
