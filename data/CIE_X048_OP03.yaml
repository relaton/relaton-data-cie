abstract:
- content: Street lighting ensures visibility and legibility for road users. In this
    paper, performances of the lighting installation of four road sections with different
    type of road surface are simulated in accordance with guidelines and road lighting
    standards. Then, the calculation of the visibility level of a target according
    to the Adrians model is included. Next, the light reflections on the road surface
    are added to the calculation of the target luminance. For this, the area considered
    in front of the target as well as the number of elementary surfaces are fixed
    and a Q_0-scaling of the r-table obtained for a=45 degree is performed. We compare
    the results obtained for each section with and without considering the light reflections
    and conclude that there is negligible incidence of the nature of the road surface
    on the target luminance. However, an effect of the road surface on the visibility
    level of the target is observed.
