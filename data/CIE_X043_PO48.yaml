abstract:
- content: The colour quality of solid state lighting is an essential theme for research
    and development. Light sources that are optimized on colour fidelity can be not
    good enough to achieve a visual acceptance of users of lighting systems. As well,
    LED - luminaires and - lamps that are optimized only on colour saturation enhancement
    should evoke an appearance of vividness, but for long-term use of lighting systems
    in professional and private areas, the judgments of colour preference factors
    with an appropriate combination of both colour fidelity and other colour metrics
    should be the correct optimization criteria of the colour quality. In addition,
    the hardware factors of LED - combination and their properties should correlate
    with the optimization process. The last phase of the optimization should be verified
    by an available visual investigation. Therefore, in this paper the discussed items
    include understanding about full optimization, optimization criteria and an available
    structure of LEDs for a solid state lighting system. Consequently, an example
    of the full optimization for a solid state lighting system in the case of human
    skins is used to demonstrate experimentally.
