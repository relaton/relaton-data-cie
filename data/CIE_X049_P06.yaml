abstract:
- content: The International Energy Agency (IEA) 4E Solid State Lighting Annex is
    planning on conducting an Interlaboratory Comparison (IC 2022) for the measurement
    of temporal light modulation (TLM) from solid state lighting (SSL) products. This
    work builds on the SSL Annex’s experience from its previous two interlaboratory
    comparisons (IC 2013, IC 2017) for measurement of SSL products. IC 2022 is organised
    to compare measured TLM waveform data and calculated short term flicker index
    (PstLM) in IEC TR 61547-1 and stroboscopic effect visibility measure (SVM, MVS)
    in IEC TR 63158, of the comparison artefacts. Four LED lamps with different TLM
    characteristics and one TLM generator source will be used as the comparison artefacts.
    IC 2022 is planned as a technical study but is designed to serve as a proficiency
    test for SSL testing accreditation programmes. Early interest has been received
    from over 20 organisations, including test laboratories, instrument manufacturers,
    lighting manufacturers, universities and research institutes. The technical protocol
    is currently being developed.
