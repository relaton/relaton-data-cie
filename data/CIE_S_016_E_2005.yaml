    To enable people to perform visual tasks efficiently and accurately, especially during
    the night, adequate and appropriate lighting has to be provided. The degree of
    visibility and comfort required in a wide range of outdoor work places is governed by
    the type and duration of activity.
    The standard specifies the lighting requirements that will contribute to the visual
    needs for safety and security within outdoor work places.
