abstract:
- content: Measurements of orientation-depending colorimetric characteristics of daylight
    conditions can be used in research, lighting design and product development, especially
    when looking into spectral selective materials or non-visual effects of light.
    To provide designers, researchers and engineers with validated spatially resolved
    spectral data, a cooperation between institutes is planned within a Research Forum
    of CIE Division 3 ?Interior Environment and Lighting Design?. The aim of this
    collaboration is an aligned approach of data collection, evaluation and representation
    of spatially resolved spectral sky data. Both collection and processing are illustrated
    by using information from measuring sites in Berlin and Beijing. The paper includes
    the description and comparison of measuring equipment, incorporating applied calibration
    procedures and discrepancies. Additionally, the paper presents examples of spectral
    data sets for both Beijing and Berlin, being a result of alignment of data evaluation
    and representation.
