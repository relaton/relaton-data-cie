abstract:
- content: In this work, a dynamic multi-channel LED lighting system is used to mimic
    natural light very precisely. First, we propose a closed-loop feedback control
    using a colour sensor to compensate for spectral shifts due to temperature changes
    or wear out of the LEDs. Second, we test the lighting system in a 24/7 working
    room over 1 year with a CCT-changing sequence designed for critical-task performing.
    Our results show that a precise control over the emitted spectrum can be achieved
    providing an unprecedented colour quality and enhancing people's level of satisfaction,
    comfort and alertness in indoor working environments.
