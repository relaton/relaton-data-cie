abstract:
- content: In the world of Smart Cities and Internet of Things (IoT), traditional
    pre-programmed street lighting dimming systems are considered obsolete. Capable
    of measuring three essential parameters for outdoor street lighting control (traffic
    volume, weather conditions and average road surface luminance), a new generation
    of sensors is providing, at reasonable costs, opportunities for new approaches
    in design, maintenance and operation of road lighting installations. Today, IoT
    technology is allowing to install, upon each lighting pole, low cost sensors,
    able to detect luminance, traffic volume and weather conditions. All these parameters
    can be accurately measured in a wide urban area. With the LIFE-Diademe project,
    110 of such devices have been installed and another 890 will be shortly available,
    for a total of 1,000 equipped lighting points, to measure, within a selected area
    in a district of Rome, relevant parameters for Adaptive Lighting control and management.
    The LIFE-Diademe project experience will be running for one year allowing to collect
    a reasonable big set of data. After this period, a new lighting measurement campaign
    will be performed and, consequently, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a Life
    Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) analysis will be carried out, in order to assess results,
    in terms of energy saving, safety, electronic waste reduction, and, finally, sustainability.
