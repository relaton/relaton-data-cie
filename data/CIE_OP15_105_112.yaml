abstract:
- content: Recent studies suggest that window glare depends on more factors than the
    four main variables, the glare source luminance, the background luminance, the
    angular size of the source, and the relative position of the source. The purpose
    of this study is to identify the effects of the type of task, the direction of
    view from the observer to the window, and the view through the window on discomfort
    glare evaluation. The effect of the angle between the line of sight and the window
    pane on GSV was not found. Although the articficial window experiment suggested
    the VDT task resulted in significantly higher GSV than the paper task, when the
    line of sight of the worker was perpendicular to the window pane, the real window
    experiment showed no significant difference. It was found that the view through
    the windows had the possibility to relieve discomfort caused by glare from windows.
