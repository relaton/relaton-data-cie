abstract:
- content: In this study, different trade-offs are discussed while developing a uniform
    colour space. Many colorimetry-based colour spaces have been developed before
    to uniformly encode colour difference signals. Researchers have reported that
    there is always a trade-off between perceptual uniformity, hue-linearity and wide
    range lightness difference. It has also been found that lightness-constancy also
    affects uniformity and hue-linearity. A perceptual colour space was developed
    by minimizing this trade-off and was named as Jzazbz. Different tradeoffs were
    achieved while developing the new colour space by predicting representative sets
    of experimental data. At the same time, its performance was compared with state-of-the-art
    uniform colour spaces.
