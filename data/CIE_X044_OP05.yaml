abstract:
- content: This research aimed to study the colour quality of LED lightings without
    confused attributions caused by the interactions of physical quantities. An experiment
    was designed to assess the naturalness, colourfulness and preference of lightings
    using tuneable multi-channel LED system to render different gamut sizes as well
    as gamut shapes under well controlled of other lighting parameters. The most natural
    and preferred gamut sizes are around 100-105 Rg (IES) values and 105-110 Rg values
    respectively. The lightings with red-green gamut shapes are judged more colourful
    than those with yellow-blue shapes while the gamut sizes are similar. Rg and ΔC*
    both have problem evaluating colourfulness under low CCT lightings. Only a single
    gamut size index, such as Rg or ΔC* cannot predict the colourfulness well.
