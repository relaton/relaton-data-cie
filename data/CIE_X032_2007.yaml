    Visual appearance can be one of the most critical parameters affecting customer choice
    therefore it needs to be quantifiable to ensure uniformity and reproducibility. A starting
    point in assessing the appearance of a consumer product might be the measurement of
    its colour. The description of its total appearance, however, cannot be achieved by the
    definition of colour alone; other attributes of the object contribute to the overall
    appearance and these might include gloss, translucency and surface texture, as well as
    the environment in which the object is seen.

    CIE Division 1 organized at the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle Paris, France
    the symposium "Visual Appearance" to report and discuss the interactions between these
    various components that provide a framework to describe and measure visual
    appearance. The interactions between the various components are complex. Physical
    parameters are related to the objects in scenes and these in turn are influenced, at the
    perception stage, by the physiological response of the human visual system and, in
    addition by the psychological aspects of human learning, pattern, culture and tradition.

    By dealing with the optical properties of materials under the four headings of
    colour, gloss, translucency and texture it is possible for measurements to be made: It is
    recognised that these measures are not necessarily independent; colour may influence
    gloss, colour will certainly influence translucency, and texture is probably a function of all
    three of the other measures.

    The Proceedings of this two-day Symposium includes invited papers and
    contributed papers as well as the material of the poster session. The topics of the papers
    spanned from theoretical review to application papers, even the description of measuring
    set-ups and instruments. A summary of the round-table discussion is also included in the
    Proceedings. It was decided that a follow-up symposium will be organized in 2-3 years
    time.

    The Proceedings contains the text of all the presented 45 papers.

    The publication consists of 263 pages with 273 figures and 23 tables.
