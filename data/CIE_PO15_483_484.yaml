- content: NMISA's LED measurement facility sphere-spectrometer measurement setup
    for total flux measurements was recalibrated to achieve lower uncertainties. The
    wavelength calibration was performed using a partial flux measurement configuration
    with the integrating sphere - array spectrometer system and pencil style wavelength
    sources. The calibration was performed on an optical bench to enable easy moving
    of lamps for better signal.
