abstract:
- content: In the applications of augmented reality, high legibility of text information
    is important to an optical see-through HMD. However, in an outdoor environment,
    bright and complex scene would greatly reduce their legibility. Hence, a series
    visual experiments were conducted to summarize the rules of text placement and
    text rendering for the type of applications. And a real-time system is made to
    demonstrate its visual effects.
