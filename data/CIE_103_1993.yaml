    103/1 Colour Appearance Analysis

    Traditional colorimetry in itself is unable to define the appearance of a colour. What are required are measures that accurately correlate with the perceived hue, saturation, chroma, colourfulness, lightness and brightness of the coloured samples when seen under specified viewing conditions.

    The Committee has selected two models that adequately predict the appearance of simple coloured stimuli under a light source whose chromaticity is not far from the Planckian locus and with a colour temperature between those of typical daylight and tungsten light.

    Four newly formed Technical Committees will follow up the present work:

        * TC 1-27: Specification of Colour Appearance for Reflective Media and Self Luminous Display Comparisons
        * TC 1-32: Prediction of Corresponding Colours
        * TC 1-33: Colour Rendering
        * TC 1-34: Testing of Colour Appearance Models
