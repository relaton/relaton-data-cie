abstract:
- content: For the quality of a short break, a dynamic lighting system suitable for
    short breaks is proposed in this study, expecting to enhance users? spirit after
    a short break. 12 participants participate in the experiment, in which the experimental
    light is with the light and shade changing cycle. The analyses of brainwave and
    heart rate variability are regarded as the nonsubjective evaluation in this experiment.
    The brainwave analysis reveals that the delta energy intensity of participants?
    brainwave is enhanced with the dynamic light and is higher than it without a light
    that they could get into sleep faster with the dynamic light. We intend to actually
    apply the dynamic light to workplaces to present the best break quality within
    the long period of working hours and the limited break time in a day. It is expected
    to enhance the work efficiency and concentration of employees with long working
    hours.
