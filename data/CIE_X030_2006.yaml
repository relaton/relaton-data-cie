abstract:
- content: "16-17 May 2006, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada\n\nCIE Division 1 and ISCC jointly
    organized a symposium to celebrate the 75th anniversary of\nthe CIE 1931 Standard
    Colorimetric Observer, to discuss the many advances that have been\nmade since
    its introduction, to understand the current state of colorimetry and colour\nappearance,
    and to provide guidance on directions for future work.\n\nThe meeting was divided
    into seven main sessions:\n\nStandard Observer\nColour Matching Functions\nInstruments
    and Standards\nTemporal and Spatial Issues\nApplication of the Standard Observer\nColour
    Appearance\nColour Differences\nColour Management\nDiscussion\n\nand included
    a Poster Session.\n\nA general theme throughout the discussion, that summarized
    the hot topics of the\nsymposium, was the need for more comprehensive colour appearance
    and colour difference\nmodels. The current models take into account only a relatively
    small number of factors that\ncan affect the appearance of objects and images.
    It was recommended that models be\ndeveloped that include the effect of spatial
    and temporal factors, that are applicable to all\nlevels of illumination from
    photopic to scotopic, and that take into account both normal\nvariations in visual
    functions and changes in visual functions with aging. \n\nA second theme was the
    assessment of visual appearance and visual differences, or more specifically,
    the\nmeasurement of other attributes of surfaces such as gloss, translucency and
    texture."
