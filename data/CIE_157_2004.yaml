    The report comprises three parts. The first part reviews the scientific principles that govern the processes of radiation-induced damage to museum objects with the aim of providing fundamental information for museum conservators and research workers. The second part reviews current knowledge and recent research to provide a commentary on the efforts of researchers to better understand how these processes may be retarded or eliminated in the museum environment. The final part gives the committee's recommendations for lighting in museums in the form of a practical procedure that covers setting up a new display and monitoring the lighting during the life of the display. This procedure takes account of the research findings that have been reviewed as well as recommendations published by other organisations, and is modelled on current practice in several of the world's leading museum institutions.

    The Report is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It consists of 35 pages with 6 figures and 8 tables.
