    The use of the luminance distribution on the dry road surface as a criterion of the quality of road lighting of traffic routes has gained acceptance in a number of countries. However, in rainy climates a road surface is moist or wet for a substantial part of the dark hours, thus reducing the quality of lighting. The aim of this report is to give information which facilitates the consideration of wet conditions in the design of road lighting installations. The information covers most aspects of road lighting for wet conditions, but is mainly in the form of a collection of experience. As research on the reflection properties of wet road surfaces is still in progress, this information is not considered final.

    The publication contains 94 pages, 37 figures and 10 tables.
