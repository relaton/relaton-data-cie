abstract:
- content: The aim of the current study was to analyse the effect of ambient illumination
    on brightness matching on a computer display. A human size light booth, equipped
    with LED and fluorescent light sources, was constructed to create uniform ambient
    illumination for visual tests with similar chromatic characteristics. The participants
    adjusted the luminance of a uniform chromatic stimulus presented on a display
    to be equal to that of the ambient. The recorded display luminance values show
    large variability among the test participants and differences between the used
    illuminations depending on the stimulus colour. In case of white stimulus, the
    matched brightness values were similar while in the case of the yellow stimulus
    the LED ambient appeared brighter. One conclusion is that when matching a display
    to its ambient in terms of brightness, observers may demonstrate less variability
    when the ambient colour is closer to the display colour.
