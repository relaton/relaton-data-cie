abstract:
- content: This paper will present preliminary results from a research project comparing
    two methods for estimating the lifetime of LED products, LM-84 (6000 h test) and
    the new EU endurance test (3600h test) including on/off cycling, that will be
    required by EU from 2021. Beside the luminous flux development for the sources
    tested, their colorimetric results will also be examined as a function of time.
    Preliminary results for two series of LED products will be presented. For one
    series, the 3600h test have been completed, for the remaining series only results
    from the 6000h test is available. Results of the luminous flux and colour maintenance
    will be presented. Initial examinations shows good agreement between the two tests
    methods for the first series of LED products measured.Â
