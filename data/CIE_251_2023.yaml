abstract:
- content: CIE standard illuminant A was introduced in 1932 to represent typical tungsten-filament
    lighting in colorimetry, and for decades it has been used as a reference spectrum
    in photometer calibrations.In 2018, CIE published new LED illuminants in CIE 015:2018
    Colorimetry, 4th Edition. Based on one of the new LED illuminants, this Technical
    Report publishes a recommendation for an LED reference spectrum, named "CIE reference
    spectrum L41", for photometer calibration that complements CIE standard illuminant
    A. Specifically, this document includes the tabulated data of CIE reference spectrum
    L41 and a quality metric for selection of white LEDs for physical LED standard
    sources.Information is provided about typical magnitudes of spectral mismatch
    errors with V(ÔÅ¨)-filtered photometers in measurements of LEDs, as well as other
    types of light sources, when CIE reference spectrum L41 is used for photometer
    calibration instead of CIE standard illuminant A.
