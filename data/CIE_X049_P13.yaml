abstract:
- content: In order to estimate the visibility of temporal light modulation (TLM),
    also known as "flicker", various metrics are employed in research and commerce.
    The metrics, however, are not easily calculated, and occasionally the values change
    depending on sampling rates. This study investigates the complexities involved
    in processing data from TLM waveform metrics and then calculating metrics. It
    explores the sensitivity of each metric to sampling rate, and recommendations
    are then provided for how to increase the accuracy and consistency of the metrics
    by using appropriate sampling rates. The analyses in this study are based on noise-free
    and stable ideal waveforms; however, sampling rate effects also exist for real-world
    waveforms.
