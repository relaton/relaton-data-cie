abstract:
- content: One of the most important motivations for lighting control in road lighting
    is energy savings. Lighting level can be reduced depending on various factors,
    including driving speed and traffic density. Detectors installed in lighting poles
    help to monitor traffic flow and provide useful data both for real time control
    as well as for analyses in order to understand traffic behaviour, to set up standardized
    lighting control profiles and to estimate possible energy saving potentials. This
    paper deals with determination of energy savings for major roads by implementing
    a suitable control profile. Data from selected sites in three cities in Slovakia
    and Czechia have been analysed. Time periods for reduced lighting levels and sustaining
    minimum level have been defined, reduction coefficient based on lighting class
    requirements have been determined and detection probabilities for each of the
    level and case study have been estimated. Energy saving potential is expressed
    in terms of the lighting operation coefficient combining in itself all of the
    mentioned factors.
