abstract:
- content: The aim of this study is to see if colour differences of colour 3D objects
    are different from 2D objects. Five colours were tested, each consisting of 2
    three-dimensional geometric shapes, 2 materials and perturbed in 3 colour attributes.
    This resulted in 52 three-dimensional colourshape combinations, using a series
    of psycho-visual experiments to quantify visual colour differences of 3D objects.
    Each colour-shape combination was assessed using 7-step grey scale under a standard
    light booth by a panel of observers with normal colour vision. Measurement data
    were compared with the psychophysical experimental data. The results show that
    the perceptual colour differences in both cube and cone shapes are similar. In
    terms of material, matte surface is better than glossy surface in  discriminating
    colour differences, especially in hue differences. Chroma differences for high
    chroma or dark colours are not easy to aware. Lighting and colour also have some
    interesting impacts on the results.
