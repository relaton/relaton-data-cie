abstract:
- content: The issue of the luminous flux radiation to the upper hemisphere is very
    broad and complex. The paper deals with the modelling of the vertical surface
    radiators. It presents an approach to unify the behaviour of these types of light
    sources. These will be understood as cosine radiators. If this cosine distribution
    curve is taken into account, then only the luminance and the light-active surface
    can be known to supplement the information about the radiation of such the light
    source. The luminance and radiated surface can be obtained relatively easily from
    real field measurements. The article presents the implementation of this data
    into lighting calculations and the creation of the distribution curves which are
    necessary for the radiation calculations of these surfaces. It also analyses the
    influence of the luminance and active areas on the radiated luminous flux and
    assign these values to the real radiators.
