abstract:
- content: This work investigates the impact of different room surface colours on
    the melanopic effectiveness of an office lighting installation. Two different
    LED spectra were weighted with the spectral reflectance function of different
    colours. The resulting spectra were then analysed regarding the impact on the
    melanopic factor. In a subsequent lighting simulation, two different lighting
    solutions with a selected set of wall colourings was used. For the indirect part
    of the vertical illuminance at the observer's eye level, a resulting amel,v was
    calculated to obtain an overall melanopic irradiance and, thus, a measure for
    the melanopic effectiveness. As expected, the results showed a strong dependency
    on the absolute values of illuminance but also on the colour of walls and ceiling
    in combination with their overall reflectance.
