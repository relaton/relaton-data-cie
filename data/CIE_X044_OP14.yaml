abstract:
- content: The purpose of this study is to model the physical lighting conditions
    associated with glare in gymnasiums. Subjective experiments were carried out in
    eight gymnasiums in Japan. The result of these subjective experiments showed that
    the larger the angle of the subject?s line of sight from the horizontal plane,
    the larger the degree of glare from the floodlight and the lower the visibility
    of the shuttlecock in front of the floodlight. Using the degree of glare as a
    dependent variable and the candidate predictor variables as independent variables,
    a multiple regression analysis was carried out and the multiple correlation equation
    was obtained. This equation shows that increasing the reflectance of the ceiling
    can reduce the degree of the glare.
