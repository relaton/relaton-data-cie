    In order to investigate suitable LED lighting conditions for viewing fine art paintings in a museum environment, the effect of correlated colour temperature(CCT)and illuminance to hu man vision was tested and studied in this paper. The experiment was conducted in a room designed to simulate the exhibition of real paintings in museums. Forty observers participated in the experiment to evaluate 6 paintings under 12 different lighting conditions. 12 lighting conditions were established on the base of 4 CCT values and 3 illuminance levels. On the base of the categorical judgement method, 13 word pairs were used to assess each painting under each lighting condition. The results showed that high illuminance will be more suitable than low
    illuminance for viewing paintings. Under high illuminance lighting condition, CCT had a little impact on visual perception. But under low illuminance lighting condition, a CCT around 3000K could bring better visual comfort.
