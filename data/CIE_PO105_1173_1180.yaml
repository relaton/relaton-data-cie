abstract:
- content: Blue light hazard is getting more and more attended recently. There are
    many methods used by researchers to measure, calculate and evaluate the blue light
    hazard. However, these methods are usually suitable for standardized studies in
    laboratory. When light sources used in a real environment, these methods couldn?t
    draw accurate results due to that the blue light hazard would be different in
    different using conditions. In this study, some mathematical models are established
    to calculate and simulate the impact on blue light hazard of measurement distance,
    measurement angle and background light. The experiment results show that blue
    light weighted radiance is related to the spatial distribution of luminance and
    the spectrum in real light environment. Meanwhile, a blue light hazard measurement
    method based on actual light environment is put forward. At last, some methods
    to avoid the blue light hazard are recommended.
