abstract:
- content: The purpose of this study is to clarify the physiological and psychological
    effects of chromatic lighting through the subjective experiments. In this paper,
    we first compared the psychological effects of various illuminance and chromatic
    lights and confirmed the main effect of light colour on psychological stress.
    In the monochromatic lights, the green lights were stressless and the red lights
    were stressful. Among the mixed lights made of two kinds of monochromatic lights,
    the yellow lights tended to be stressless. We also examined the additivity of
    psychological stress from the viewpoint of irradiance. The result shows that the
    additivity could be assumed among blue, red, and their mixed light magenta at
    the conditions of 53 lx in front of the eyes, however, the additivity of other
    mixed colour lights needs to be investigated in the future with more experimental
    data.
