abstract:
- content: 'Due to the influence of COVID-19, there is a need to create an environment
    where people can relax and feel special in a separated space. Therefore, in this
    study, we will clarify the psychological changes that occur when people are surrounded
    by an unusual environment.This study prepared eight LED lighting colours: red,
    orange, yellow, green, blue, light blue, purple, and white. The room was illuminated,
    and the participants were asked to evaluate their impressions using the SD method
    on a 7-point scale.As a result of impression evaluation, red gave a warm impression,
    yellow gave a bright impression, blue gave a cold impression, and purple gave
    a mature impression, just like the psychological effects of colours. Green gave
    an artificial impression that was different from the psychological effects of
    the other colours.From these results, we can conclude that impressions do not
    correlate with colour symbolism when the entire room is illuminated with coloured
    light. In the future, we will clarify the relationship between wavelength and
    impression by studying the spectral distribution of each light source.'
