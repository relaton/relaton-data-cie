abstract:
- content: This study attempts to simulate the metamerism colour, and the guava was
    used as the target object. We design four sets of metamers with a correlated colour
    temperature of 4000K and an illuminance of 750lux. The light source was simulated
    in the LED cube. The subjects with convenience sampling observed the visual effects,
    including look delicious, colourful, and colour rendering of guava under metamerism,
    then analysed its relationship with CRI and CQS. The results showed that colour
    rendering and visual effects are not a positive relationship, and the effect of
    CQS is closer to the visual effects of the subjects. The results of this study
    can be used as a reference for light source lighting designers as a basis for
    improving lighting conditions. In the future, we can collect databases for the
    different objects with an optimized multi-spectral light source.
