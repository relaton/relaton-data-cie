    This technical report supplements CIE 12.2-1977 Recommendations for the Lighting of Roads for Motorized Traffic. It describes details of technologies and work processes which are required to achieve the objectives put forward in CIE 12.2-1977.

    It treats lighting problems which arise form certain discontinuities not mentioned in CIE 12.2-1977 (e.g. humps or multi-level works). It also takes into account the evolution of newer techniques (e.g. new sources, high masts, or catenary lighting).

    The publication contains 33 pages, 25 figures and 1 table.
