abstract:
- content: Tungsten lamps have been widely used by calibration laboratories as reference
    standards lamps. However, they are gradually phased out in recently years owing
    to the evolution of more energy efficient with extended operating life lamps.
    Light emitting diode (LED) lamps are solid-state devices which are rugged, have
    much longer operating life and have much better efficiency than tungsten lamps.
    Recently, a technical committee has been set up under CIE to study the use of
    the LEDs as reference light sources. To support the calibration demands from the
    local industries, the Standards and Calibration Laboratory (SCL) of Hong Kong,
    China has set up calibration service for total luminous flux, spectral radiant
    flux and correlated colour temperature of LED lamps and tungsten lamps. The calibration
    methods and its associated measurement uncertainties are presented in this paper.
