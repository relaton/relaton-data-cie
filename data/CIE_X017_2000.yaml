    The Proceedings of the 24th Session of the CIE, Warsaw, 24-30 June 1999, were published in two volumes, CIE 133-1999, containing the papers read at the Session, as well as the Introductory Papers for the Round Table Discussions. Volume 2 contains reports on General Functions, Divisional Meetings and Workshops.

    Every effort was taken both on the side of the Organising Committee and the CIE Central Bureau to publish in these two volumes an accurate and up to date overview of CIE activities and contributions of its members. As this is most often the case, a compromise had to be drawn between completeness and timely publication, and thus several post deadline manuscripts had to be left out. These manuscripts had been collected at the CIE Central Bureau and it had been decided to devote a special volume, x017-2000, to these late papers and make them available to the CIE community.

    Thus in this publication - which is not an official CIE Publication - you will find the text of 15 papers left out from CIE 133-1999, due to the fact that they were not available at the time of sending the volume to the printers.

    The CIE Central Bureau hopes that with this special volume it not only contributes to the proper archiving of all the activities that took place at the 24th Session, but also provides to the interested reader a number of important papers.
    The publication contains 62 pages.
