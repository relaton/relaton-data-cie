abstract:
- content: The hue perceptions of the near-white lightings were investigated after
    the subjects' eyes were adapted to 5000K. Total of 48 test colours around 5000K
    were generated by using 5 channels LED lighting booth for the psychophysical experiment.
    Five subjects judged hue of each test lighting twice. The results showed that
    unique yellow-blue colours are closely located around the Plankian locus while
    unique red-green colours roughly follow the line orthogonal to the Plankian locus
    in u'v' colour space. The colour appearance model performance test results showed
    that CIECAM02 showed a better performance than CAM02u. Also, green-to-blue range
    colours and red-to-yellow range colours in CIECAM02 are perceived as mostly blue
    and yellow colours, respectively.
