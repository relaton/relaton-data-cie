abstract:
- content: The reflecting glare formed by large area glass curtain wall in city has
    become the main light pollution in daytime, and the influence of strong glare
    is becoming more and more serious. This paper classifies the factors of harmful
    reflection glare on glass curtain wall. The computer simulation experiments of
    various influencing factors were carried out, and the statistical simulation data
    were analysed. Finally, the general law of the control design of harmful reflection
    light control for glass curtain wall was obtained. Based on the previous research,
    this paper proposed a new method for reflection glare prediction, the BTA method.
    By computer simulations of simplified building model, this paper analysed each
    influencing factor, which showed different response characteristics. Combined
    with design process, with urban, building and curtain construction factors considered,
    the strategy and guideline of glare control of glass curtain wall had been proposed.
