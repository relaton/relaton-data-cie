abstract:
- content: The measurement and classification of light is essential across many scientific
    disciplines. Devices used to measure light range from the highly precise scanning
    spectroradiometers to the more practical compact multichannel filter-array type
    imaging sensors and the ubiquitous RGB pixel. While there have been numerous successful
    efforts to reconstruct spectrum from RGB, RGB-to-spectrum reconstruction has historically
    been limited to natural scenes and other edge cases under strict constraints.
    However, information theory and recent advances in deep learning have shed new
    light on the vast amount of redundancy contained within data collected in the
    natural world, including light. In this paper, we will investigate how analytic
    methods can help map high dimensional spectra data to a low-dimensional feature
    space with minimal inductive bias. Through a better understanding of the intrinsic
    dimension of the data, we can use the features expressed in this representation
    to exploit regularities and make tasks like data compression, measurement and
    classification more efficient. The aim of this analysis is to help inform how
    and when low-dimensional representation of spectra is useful in practice for designing
    compact sensors as well as for lossy data compression and robust classification.
