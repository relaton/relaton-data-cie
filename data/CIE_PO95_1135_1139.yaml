abstract:
- content: Due to new technologies increase the public lighting gets currently into
    a ground-breaking phase. It is necessary to consider carefully how and where public
    lighting is heading forward and whether it is necessary to prepare for any changes
    right now so that we could use a potential of the public lighting, especially
    in connection to SMART CITIES. Two basic technologies influencing the public lighting
    are LED technology and its rapid and progressive development of communication
    technologies, particularly the development of optical fibre networks and mobile
    networks 5G. By their combination we can achieve not only the visibility increase
    due to the influence of better primary colour properties of a luminous flux and
    significantly better possibilities of its directing to the roads, but chiefly
    the usage of control options of each luminaire, which has already been proved
    to be crucial. The power system designed that way can be used throughout 24 hours
    as well as it can charge terminal active elements of technologies falling into
    the category of SMART CITY (free Wi-Fi for the population, IP camera systems,
    providing technologies that facilitate car to car and car to infrastructure communication
    WAVEp, environmental measurement and dynamic traffic management).
