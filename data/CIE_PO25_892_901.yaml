abstract:
- content: It is vitally important to estimate visibility in order to maintain a visual
    safety especially for low-vision people. Authors have agreed that it is reasonable
    to establish a method to estimate visibility of objects using luminance images,
    and proposed C-A graph (Nakamura et al. 2016) based on contrast profile method
    (Nakamura et al. 2003). C-A graph presents luminance contrast and logarithmic
    average on vertical and horizontal axes for varying object sizes respectively.
    In this study, two experiments were conducted in order to consider visibility
    estimation method using C-A graph. The first experiment was conducted to obtain
    visibility threshold conditions and the second experiment was conducted to examine
    the relationship between visibility threshold values and visibility evaluation.
