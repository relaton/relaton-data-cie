abstract:
- content: The present study focuses on the optical properties of functionalized surfaces
    and how the surface geometry impacts them. Physical measurements of reflected
    light are required to understand the visual aspect of such surfaces. Bidirectional
    Reflection Distribution Function (BRDF) is evaluated in order to identify and
    understand physical effects induced by different surface functionalization. BRDF
    measurements of high angular resolution allow us to observe diffraction phenomenon
    at an unusual scale. Experimental results were compared to theoretical calculation,
    and then diffraction effect was confirmed. This study stresses that diffractive
    phenomenon could have an impact on visual aspect even for simple pattern geometry.
    In the same way, if more complex periodic patterns are considered, as multistate
    periodicity pattern for example, it could rise to important modification of surface
    visual aspect.
