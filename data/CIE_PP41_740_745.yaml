abstract:
- content: Subjective evaluation of legibility and glaring effect was done using a
    projection-type presentation of letters with a head-up-display for 28 young and
    30 older people. Effects of luminance on those two measures were clarified for
    five levels of background together with the aging effects on them. The legibility
    score increases with the letter luminance, but a glare feeling occurs at extremely
    high letter luminance, which is much more pronounced for young people than older
    people. From these data, the appropriate range of letter luminance is defined
    as a function of the background luminance. Contrast was found to be not a constant
    measure of legibility among different background luminances, although legibility
    increased monotonically with contrast. An effect of brightness increase of luminous
    mode presentation is observed at extremely high luminance of letters, which has
    not been reported for reflected images.
