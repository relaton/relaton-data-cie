abstract:
- content: 'Current lighting design practice related to most indoor environments has
    been achieved through the same design methods and guidelines originally developed
    over a century ago. This needs to change because visual needs of people in modern
    ways of life are evolving; demands for better quality and reduced energy are increasing.
    An alternative exitance-based lighting design methodology has been suggested with
    the intention of achieving better quality lighting. Perceived Adequacy of Illumination
    (PAI) and Illumination Hierarchy (IH) criteria are proposed as the basis of this
    new method. There are two metrics associated with these criteria: Mean Room Surface
    Exitance (MRSE) and Target - Ambient Illuminance Ratio (TAIR). The MRSE metric
    has been examined to determine if it is better and whether it can be easily evaluated
    and measured. This paper focuses on measurement of MRSR and provides data about
    spatial or surrounding brightness and MRSE levels in real life installations designed
    with existing methods.'
