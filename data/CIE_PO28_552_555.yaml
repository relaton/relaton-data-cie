abstract:
- content: Light-emitting diode (LED) lighting becomes the mainstream of lighting
    products. The construction of colourful LED lighting system can be based on human
    factor, well-being, and human health including physiological and psychological
    effects. Automatic change and peopleoriented intelligent lighting system achieve
    the smart life environment. Under normal physiological conditions, the most important
    factors affecting the physiological clock (circadian rhythm) are the coordination
    of light and dark changes, movement, diet, and physiological clocks of whole cells.
    The response curve of circadian stimulus / photometry (CSP) is the definition
    of circadian action factor (CAF) which is an indicator of physiological light
    stimulus. However, the psychological influence of colourful LED luminaire is a
    complex and important issue to study the mental effect of integrative lighting.
