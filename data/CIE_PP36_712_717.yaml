abstract:
- content: This paper deals with investigation of the measurement various methods
    in goniophotometric measurements using various OLEDs samples with different goniophotometers
    i.e. light source rotating goniophotometer, mirror goniophotometer, near-field
    goniophotometer with imaging photometer, goniophotometer with rotating arm with
    photometer and rotating light source around of OLED's axis. Cooperation between
    testing laboratories having these types of goniophotometers is presented.
