    To enable people to perform visual tasks efficiently and accurately, especially during the night, adequate and appropriate lighting has to be provided. The degree of visibility and comfort required in a wide range of outdoor work places is governed by the type and duration of activity.

    This standard specifies requirements for lighting of tasks in most outdoor work places and their associated areas in terms of quantity and quality of illumination. In addition recommendations are given for good lighting practice. All usual visual tasks are considered.

    After the definitions of terms, the standard gives detailed information on lighting design criteria. Fifteen tables specify the lighting requirements for various areas, tasks and activities, and a short chapter recommends verification procedures. Following a bibliography, an extensive index of areas, tasks and activities facilitates consultation of the tables of the standard.

    A further CIE Standard giving the specific requirements for safety and security in outdoor work places is to follow as CIE S 016/E:2005 shortly.
