abstract:
- content: There is a rising concern that some smart lights may be less energy efficient
    than their regular counterpart. Standby-mode, in particular, is scrutinized. Assessing
    the energy efficiency of these products actually tends to be difficult, due to
    their many operating modes, ancillary features, non-conventional usage, etc. This
    paper reports on an ongoing project on the energy efficiency of home and office
    smart lighting products. Results put forward only concern residential products
    and are dedicated metrology methods (e.g. measuring a colour-changing lamp) and
    an open electric and photometric properties database.
