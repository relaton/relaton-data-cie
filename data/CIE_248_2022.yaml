abstract:
- content: 'A colour appearance model provides a viewing-condition-specific method
    for the transformation of the tristimulus values, X, Y, Z, to or from perceptual
    attribute correlates.This publication describes a specific colour appearance model,
    CIECAM16, which may be useful for colour management systems, used in the imaging
    industries, that involve related colours. The main applications of the model are
    the evaluation of photographic prints and self-luminous displays, where the colours
    will be perceived as related colours.This model is based on the CAM16 colour appearance
    model. It consists of a chromatic adaptation transform and equations to calculate
    a set of perceptual attribute correlates using the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric
    observer. This report provides revisions to the CIE colour appearance model for
    colour management systems that involve related colours, CIECAM02. The CIECAM16
    model is simpler than the original CIECAM02 model, but it maintains the same prediction
    performance for visual data as the original model.The evolution and application
    of this colour appearance model, CIECAM16, are presented, as is additional information
    about the use of the model in practical applications. This Technical Report replaces
    CIE 159:2004 "A colour appearance model for colour management systems: CIECAM02".'
