abstract:
- content: 'This study investigated the impact of shape on chromatic induction of
    a background colour. In visual experiments, an observer matched colour appearance
    of a square sample presented on a grey background with that of a test sample varying
    in shapes on a chromatic background. Six shapes were tested: square, circle, diamond,
    isosceles triangle, right-angled triangle and hexagon, on four backgrounds including
    red, yellow, green and blue. The differences between the test colour and its corresponding
    colours were quantified in terms of total colour difference, dE*ab. The results
    showed that different shapes induced different levels of chromatic induction as
    a result of a chromatic background. Circle increased the simultaneous contrast
    effect the most, while diamond made the effect disappear, i.e. no changes of colour
    appearance due to the background colour.'
