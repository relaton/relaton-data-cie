    CIE Technical Committee TC 6-24 was formed in 1992 due to the importance
    of the deleterious effects associated with exposure to UV-A radiation and
    because of a lack of existing guidance/regulations on tests for UV-A
    protection. The objective was to arrive at an international consensus on such
    tests. By 1997 the committee had identified one in vivo method worth
    pursuing, i.e. Persistent Pigment Darkening, and several in vitro methods that
    had not yet been validated. It was not possible to reach a consensus at that
    time, however. In the meantime the development of methods to assess UV-A
    protection continued and is still on-going, especially on in vitro methods.
    Furthermore, the computer-aided calculation of sunscreen performance -
    referred to as in silico - became more sophisticated and useful. Rather than
    trying to find a consensus on sunscreen testing the objective of the
    reactivated TC 6-24 has now been reduced to giving, in the form of a
    Technical Report, a comprehensive overview as well as an assessment and
    ranking of the UV-A methods currently under discussion. This report starts
    with the general principles of UV protection and an overview of UV-A and
    broad-spectrum UV filters. Then a description and assessment of in vivo, ex
    vivo, in vitro and in silico methods is given.
