abstract:
- content: The first part of this paper focuses on the analysis of influence factors
    of discomfort glare. The analysis is based on a literature review by the author
    and numerous studies carried out from the mentioned students until 2006. Most
    of the results are unpublished. The analysis shows that the illuminance at the
    eye strongly influences glare perception. The luminance of the glare source has
    a high significant effect as well. Some more recent studies findings describe
    the impact of spectral power distribution. Additionally, the influence of lamp
    type, luminance distribution of glare source, age and experience of the driver,
    as well as used methods and test stimuli are considered. After the review and
    analysis, a new model for the estimation of discomfort glare of headlamps is discussed.
