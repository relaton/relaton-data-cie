abstract:
- content: For field research of non-visual effects of light, accurate measurement
    of personal light exposure is required. A consensus framework for light-dosimetry
    could improve non-visual field research and ensure comparability between studies.
    Here we present a review of methodologies used in non-visual light-dosimetry studies
    published to date, focussing on considerations regarding the measurement and preparation
    of personal light exposure data. Overall, a large variability in the studies methodologies
    is observed, highlighting the need for a consensus framework. We propose methodological
    considerations that should be included in such a framework and that can guide
    future studies. Furthermore, we highlight important points that should be addressed
    in future research to ensure compatibility between different dosimetry studies.
    Taken together, this review effort underlines the importance of a systematic approach
    to light-dosimetry in order to harness all the power of integrative lighting research
    in real-life.
