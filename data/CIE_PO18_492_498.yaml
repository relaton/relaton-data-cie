abstract:
- content: In this study, the optical design of the packaging lens which has achromatic
    ability is proposed in the white light LED. In order to protect the LED chip and
    reduce colour dispersion, the LED chip is bonded on a rectangular reflective cup
    and embedded in a packaging lens which is composed by three different mediums.
    The shapes of the interfaces between the mediums are designed accord to the refractive
    indices of the medium. In order to comprehend the order of the colour dispersion,
    the range of colour dispersion (RCD) at specific normalized intensity is analysed.
    According to the analysing results, the design of the achromatic packaging lens
    can reduce the colour dispersion obviously. In the case of the reflective cup
    has no reflectivity, the RCD value at zero normalized intensity even achieves
    one degrees. However, while the reflective cup causes the increasing in RCD value,
    a considerable improvement still can be achieved by the design of the free-form
    reflective cup.
