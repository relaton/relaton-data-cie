abstract:
- content: In visual design, harmony refers to the similarity among objects and the
    components of these objects that appear as if they belong together. Harmony is
    related to the body, mind, and emotions as we relate to our living space, which
    means that the harmony of real objects is an important characteristic. Moreover,
    harmony might be affected by the shared traits between objects, such as their
    colour, shape, texture, and material. Although the appearance harmony in specific
    materials has been investigated, harmony among different materials has not received
    adequate attention. In our previous study, we investigated the appearance harmony
    among various materials by psychophysical experiments. In this study, we analysed
    the psychophysical evaluations obtained from our previous experiments, and the
    physical properties of the materials. We found that the property of texture represented
    by the anisotropy histogram was an important index that can be used to judge the
    harmony of materials.
