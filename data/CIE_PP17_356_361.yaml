abstract:
- content: A psychophysical experiment was carried out to study the white appearance
    of a tablet display under 17 ambient lighting conditions with different chromaticities,
    including one dark condition, seven conditions with chromaticities on the Planckian
    locus, and nine conditions with chromaticities off the Planckian locus. A panel
    of sixty-three naive observers participated in the study. One-standard deviation
    error ellipses were used to define the boundary of white appearance; the bivariate
    Gaussian distribution were used to correlate the degree of white with the chromaticities.
    It was found that both the boundary of white appearance and the degree of white
    appearance varied with the ambient lighting conditions. The findings also suggested
    that the degree of chromatic adaptation was low under the low CCT illuminants.
