abstract:
- content: In this follow-up paper, a display-based experiment on inter-cultural image
    quality assessment should be presented. In the course of preparing the experiment,
    four different functional colour image transforms were adopted and applied to
    eight different test images. The processed images were subsequently presented
    to Chinese and German observers in a paired-comparison experiment. The mean preference
    ratings of both observer groups were eventually analysed in terms of z-score values.
