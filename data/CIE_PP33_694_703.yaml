abstract:
- content: We present an a priori analytic model for the photo-emission spectrum of
    single colour LEDs. The model establishes a close connection between the spectral
    properties of LEDs and the underlying solid state physics and can in principle
    be used to predict the photo-emission spectrum of an LED from only a few of its
    semiconductor properties. The full model is compared to a simpler, empiric, model
    by fitting the two models to a large set of experimental LED spectra. The simple
    model is well suited for good quality fitting of real LED spectra.
