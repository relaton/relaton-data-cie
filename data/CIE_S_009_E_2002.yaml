abstract:
- content: "Lamps were developed and produced in large quantities and became commonplace
    in an era\nwhen industry-wide safety standards were not the norm. The evaluation
    and control of optical\nradiation hazards from lamps and lamp systems is a far
    more complicated subject than similar\ntasks for a single-wavelength laser system.
    \n\nThe required radiometric measurements are quite involved, for they do not
    deal with the simple optics of a point source, but rather with an extended source
    that may or may not be altered by diffusers or projection optics. Also the wavelength
    distribution of the lamp may be altered by ancillary optical elements, diffusers,\nlenses,
    and the like, as well as variations in operating conditions.\n\nTo evaluate a
    broad-band optical source, such as an arc lamp, an incandescent lamp, a fluorescent
    lamp, an array of lamps or a lamp system, it is first necessary to determine the
    spectral distribution of optical radiation emitted from the source at the point
    or points of nearest human access. This accessible emission spectral distribution
    of interest for a lighting system may differ from that actually being emitted
    by the lamp alone due to the filtration by any optical elements (e.g., projection
    optics) in the light path. Secondly, the size,\nor projected size, of the source
    must be characterized in the retinal hazard spectral region.\n\nThirdly, it may
    be necessary to determine the variation of irradiance and effective radiance\nwith
    distance. The performance of the necessary measurements is normally not an easy
    task\nwithout sophisticated instruments. Thus it was decided to include reference
    measurement\ntechniques for lamps and lamp systems in this standard. The measurement
    techniques along\nwith the described risk group classification scheme will provide
    common ground for both lamp\nmanufacturers and users to define the specific photobiological
    hazards of any given lamp\nand/or lamp system.\n\nFinally, there are well known
    optical radiation hazards associated with some lamps\nand lamp systems. The purpose
    of this standard is to provide a standardized technique for\nevaluation of potential
    radiation hazards that may be associated with various lamps and lamp\nsystems."
