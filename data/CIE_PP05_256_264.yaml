abstract:
- content: Based on the investigation and discussion of the lighting system in the
    smart city of Tianjin, this paper analyses the existing problems of the road lighting
    system and summarizes the solutions. Relying on DIALUX software to build the urban
    road model foundation space to simulate the urban lighting system. Analysis the
    data, using the DIALUX Lighting computing Wizard to find out the best application
    strategies for each kind of the light source. Establish the contrast light source,
    and combine with the new light source parameters, find out the best application
    strategies for the LED light source. Based on the best application strategies,
    analysis and simulate the data, at last calculate the relevant benefits, including
    the economic benefits, the energy benefits and the environmental benefits.
