    Committee TC 1-10, Colorimetry of Self-Luminous Displays, was formed in response to the growing need to establish standardization in the measurement, design and perception of colour on visual display units (VDU's) - sometimes called self-luminous displays (SLD's).

    The major concern in TC 1-10 was to establish the state-of-knowledge which would encompass the general performance of colour VDU's, the measurement of their colorimetric characteristics, the use of colour in display design under various viewing conditions and the perceptual aspects of colour on VDU's.

    This technical report compiles a list of technical books and papers dealing with the Colorimetry of Self-Luminous Displays. Annotated references and abstracts are included where available. The report is divided into four general groups:

        * Classical colorimetry as used in colour visual display units
        * Colorimetric measurement, technical standards, uncertainties involved with assessing the colour on VDU's
        * Colour design and use on visual display units
        * Colour perception.

    The Technical Report consists of 40 pages.
