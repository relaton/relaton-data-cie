abstract:
- content: 'Although light is defined as electromagnetic radiation that provides the
    stimulus for vision, we now know conclusively that ocular detection of this signal
    also has many other physiological and psychological effects in humans and other
    organisms. This knowledge has led some to argue for rapid adoption of lighting
    recommendations that incorporate "lighting for health" elements, whereas others
    have argued that a more cautious approach would be wiser. CIE created Technical
    Committee 3-46 to outline a research agenda that could lead to evidence-based
    recommendations for healthful interior lighting within the context of delivering
    good lighting quality. The starting point for this work was CIE publication 158:2004/2009
    and its five principles for healthy lighting. Although not a comprehensive review
    of the literature on this vast topic, this report summarizes the state of knowledge
    at the time of publication and identifies gaps in our understanding that in the
    view of the committee ought to be filled in order to support safe and beneficial
    future uses of light. The report delivers a research roadmap of questions in themed
    groups: Fundamental Processes, Daily Pattern, Longer Patterns, Application, Application
    - Specific, and Individual Differences. The roadmap indicates the ease with which
    each question might be answered and its importance to lighting application in
    the short term. Design considerations and the ethics of using light to influence
    health also receive attention.'
