    According to statistics, lighting accounts for a significant proportion of the total energy consumption of retail buildings. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the illumination situation and reality of retail buildings, aiming at reducing the energy consumption. In this
    paper, the artificial lighting environment of two retail buildings in Beijing were investigated, and five physical quantities - space illuminance, commodity illuminance, general colour rendering index, correlated colour temperature - were measured, and visual comfort was
    subjectively evaluated at the same time. On the statistical analysis of survey data, this study indicates that the illuminance in retail buildings are much higher than the existing norms, but visual comfort still remains to be improved. This paper summarizes existing problems of the artificial lighting environment in retail buildings and provides support for reducing lighting energy consumption, for enhancing visual comfort of lighting environment, and for improving consumer?s shopping experience.
