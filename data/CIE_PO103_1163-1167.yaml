abstract:
  content: An experiment was carried out at the elderly patients wards to investigate
    the effect of the spectrum tunable lighting and its' dynamic scheme on their sleep
    quality and daytime alertness. Twenty-one elderly patients randomly assigned to
    the experimental and control groups, and they were exposed to the different lighting
    environments for 6 days. To measure the parameters of sleep quality and alertness
    level, a smart band, saliva melatonin and cortisol samples, some questionnaires
    were used. Although the melatonin and cortisol levels fell within a certain range
    of concentration, but there was no significant difference between two groups and
    during the period. Also, the sleep quality results based on the wearable device
    were similar. However, some sleep satisfaction questions showed a marginally significant
    difference between groups. The partially confirmed results were discussed in terms
    of small sample size and large individual difference and a persistent measurement
    and additional methods were suggested.
