abstract:
- content: CIE 140-2019 is a revision and update of CIE Publication 140-2000 Road
    Lighting Calculations. It replaces CIE 140-2000. In comparison to the previous
    edition, clauses in this report are corrected and improved where necessary, taking
    into account recent CIE publications. Values of luminous intensity are generally
    not per kilolumen, taking into account LED luminaires. The calculation of the
    threshold increment (TI) is improved and the previous calculation formula is corrected.
    The edge illuminance ratio (EIR) is introduced, replacing the surround ratio (SR),
    previously used. The linear interpolation method is accepted as satisfactory for
    application both in I-tables as well as r-tables. A new Test Data clause is prepared
    to provide a standard set of input data for testing purposes together with benchmark
    results of the calculated lighting quality criteria of road lighting installations.
