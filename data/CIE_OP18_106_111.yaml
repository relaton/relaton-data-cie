abstract:
- content: With the technology development of LED lighting, more energy-saving measures
    available to be applied. This study investigates how illuminance and spectral
    power distribution (SPD) affect the ability of human facial expression recognition,
    representing identification the intent of other people - a critical task for pedestrians
    of road lighting. This study demonstrates that the effect of facial expression
    recognition is similar whether used 2D or 3D target stimuli, which verifies the
    results of past studies used 2D target stimuli are effective. The performance
    of facial expression recognition reaches 50 % when illumination higher than 1.00
    lx. It also suggest that a lamp with higher scotopic/photopic ratio (S/P value)
    cannot improve the ability of recognizing facial expression. The results are expected
    to provide further scientific basis in formulating road lighting standards for
    more suitable LED lighting source.
