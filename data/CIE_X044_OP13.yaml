abstract:
- content: There are larger individual deviations in sensation of discomfort caused
    by high luminance glare sources. This is especially true for older observers.
    It is therefore inappropriate to simply average discomfort glare ratings evaluated
    by older observers. This study examined individual visual characteristics and
    conducted glare evaluations of glare sources with different apparent sizes for
    young and older subjects. Based on the experimental data, this study analyzed
    the relationship between each of the visual characteristics and Borderline between
    Comfort and Discomfort (BCD) luminance. The results of the analyses suggested
    that for the small glare source people who have clearer lenses and larger pupils,
    and therefore higher retinal illuminance values tend to have lower BCD luminance
    values. On the other hand, for the larger glare source, people who have larger
    effective (clear) lens areas seem to have higher BCD luminance values. However,
    people with very small effective lens areas seem to also have high BCD luminance
    values. Based on such conflicting experimental results, potential mechanisms of
    discomfort glare sensation were discussed.
