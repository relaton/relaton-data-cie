abstract:
- content: Recently, the Energy Saving Act (Act on the Rational Use of Energy) places
    importance on daylight harvesting as an energy-saving method in non-residential
    buildings, of which openings are indispensable for a better working environment.
    The purpose of this study is to examine whether the estimation method which makes
    it possible to evaluate the energysaving effect of daylighting harvesting in simple
    and quantitative way. Results show that the influence of factors related to building
    shape (Window-to-Wall Ratio, Window Number, Depth, Window Orientation) on Annual
    Primary Energy Consumption can be handled centrally by using Window-to-Floor Ratio.
