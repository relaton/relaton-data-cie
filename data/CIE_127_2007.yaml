    This report is an update of the previously published CIE Technical Report CIE 127-1997.
    There are significant differences between LEDs and other light sources which
    made it necessary for the CIE to introduce new quantities for their characterization
    with precisely defined measurement conditions. New quantities introduced here are
    "Averaged LED Intensity" and "Partial LED Flux".

    The report describes in detail the measurement conditions for ALI (Averaged
    LED Intensity), Total and Partial LED Flux and Spectral Power Distribution. It is
    shown that measurements by substitution method using LED standards can be
    simpler; however it is important to compare similar coloured LEDs or use colour
    correction on the measurement results. The standard LEDs need to be calibrated by
    National Metrology Laboratories or a laboratory traceable to National Metrology
    Laboratories.

    The report is written in English, with a short summary in French and German.
