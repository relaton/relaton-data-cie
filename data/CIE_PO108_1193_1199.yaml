abstract:
- content: European patients undergoing surgery have about 2.6% chance to develop
    a post-operative infection. Besides pain and discomfort, these infections can
    lead to hospital readmission, additional surgical procedures and even the decease
    of the patient. The ventilation system provides clean air that descends on the
    patient and protects the patient from bei ng infected by pathogens. The surgical
    lighting system provides adequate lighting to the wound, ensuring a high illuminance,
    even in challenging conditions as deep and narrow wounds. Currently, the protecting
    airflow is perturbed by the shape, position and heat of the surgical lighting
    system, causing turbulent air flows. Post-operative infections may originate as
    particles from outside the protective zone enter the surgical site by these turbulent
    air flows. To reduce this disturbance of the laminar airflow by the surgical lighting,
    we have developed an integrated concept of an LED-based and automated light source,
    mounted above a transparent ventilation chamber. This paper outlines the optical
    design of the new surgical light source and its performance.
