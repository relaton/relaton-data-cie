abstract:
- content: With the popularity of LEDs in traffic signal and sign application, it
    is important to ensure that driver can adequately identify these signals, especially
    in the changing weather and the complex ambient light level conditions. Due to
    the characteristics of small light-emitting area and high directivity, LEDs are
    considered more probable to induce glare that disturbs human's visual sensation.
    To investigate the visibility and visual comfort of LED traffic signs, a psychophysical
    experiment is designed and performed. Ultimately, we hope it can be able to extend
    to a variety of research of LED traffic signal and sign devices, and be a reference
    for the future smart traffic systems, to provide an effective, safe and comfortable
    transport lighting environment.
