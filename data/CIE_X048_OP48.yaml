abstract:
- content: Spaciousness is an important quality of space which is affected by both
    the volume of space and the lighting environment. This studys aim is to create
    the calculation model to quantify the effect of lighting environment on spaciousness.
    3D luminance mapping, which is the combined data of luminance of surface and its
    distance to the observer, is used for the analysis of lighting environment, because
    we hypothesized that the three-dimensional localization of light affects the spaciousness.
    From the result of a subjective experiment to evaluate spaciousness with different
    lighting environment, it is revealed that spaciousness can be quantified from
    average luminance and Dark-part-reduced visible volume which is the reduced visible
    volume according to the distribution of dark pixels in the 3D luminance mapping.
    We also compared average illuminance of whole image and of ceiling, walls, floor,
    and concluded that the whole average illuminance best describes the effect.
