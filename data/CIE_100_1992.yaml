abstract:
- content: "This report presents the principal fundamental information known about
    the visual task of driving at night and provides insights as to how these principals
    may be used to make roadways safer and improve traffic flow at night. The first
    chapter describes the visual task of driving and establishes the elements in the
    perceptual process, such as visual attention, detection, recognition, decision
    making and visually guided responses. It then discusses how night driving differs
    from daylight operations. It deals with questions of fine and coarse spatial vision,
    vision near detection, threshold and colour vision in night driving situations.\n\nChapter
    two identifies and critically evaluates how the night driver acquires information
    from the roadway scene and discusses what are the important cues needed for vehicular
    operation.\n\nThe third chapter discusses the required sight distances for carrying
    out the three major subtasks in driving:\n\npositional task:\n  --maintenance
    of lateral position and of correct heading, \nsituational task:\n   --avoidance
    of hazards and executing proper manoeuvers, \nnavigational task:\n  --route selection
    and following. \n\nChapter four discusses visibility models and their potential
    uses.\n\nThe final chapter suggests methods for improving road design for nighttime
    conditions. Design elements discussed include public and vehicular lighting, the
    use of retroreflective materials and the use of self-luminous signals.\n\nThe
    report contains 70 pages, 9 figures and 8 tables, and a detailed bibliography."
