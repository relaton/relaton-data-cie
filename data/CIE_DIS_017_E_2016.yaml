    CIE has published Draft International Standard CIE DIS 017/E:2016 ILV: International Lighting Vocabulary, 2nd Edition. This draft of a new edition of the International Lighting Vocabulary (ILV) is the result of intensive work carried out by CIE JTC 8 in order to harmonize the content of the ILV in its version of 2011 (published as CIE S 017:2011) with the content of the International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV), subject area ?Lighting? (IEC 60050-845), considering the rules for drafting definitions as given in the ISO/IEC Directives. In addition parallel work in ISO/TC 12/WG 19 (Revision ISO 80000, all parts) was considered in the harmonization process.

    Supplementary to the review of existing definitions, terms and definitions of CIE S 017-SP1 have been included in this draft. Terms and definitions that had been under discussion in CIE TC 1-64, terms and definitions that have been agreed in ISO/TC 274, terms and definitions of CIE TN 002, and entries which proved to be reasonable during revision work were also added to the draft. A number of entries currently included in CIE S 017:2011 have been removed, either because they became obsolete as synonyms for other terms or because they were not explicitly related to light and lighting. The numbering of entries has been changed to a sectional system to be in line with the system used in IEC 60050-845.

    The DIS has been sent to CIE National Committees (NCs), CIE Divisions and CIE Board of Administration (BA) for comments. It is still subject to changes and may not yet be referred to as a CIE International Standard. When approved by the CIE NCs, Divisions and BA it will be published as a CIE International Standard and will be forwarded to IEC to update the current version of IEC 60050-845.

    The publication consists of 183 pages and includes definitions of 1255 terms.
