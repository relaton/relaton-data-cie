abstract:
- content: According to the statistic published by Chinese National Tourism Bureau,
    during the holiday from 1st October to 7th October 2017, the number of tourists
    who travelled in the mainland China reaches 663 millions, and it has 11.96 % jump
    if compared to last year, and the total income reaches RMB 549 billions! Statistic
    also showed that there is a tremendous increase of the the number of the tourists
    who paid a visit to Ancient Town. There is a trend that the people who stay and
    work in city areas (such as metropolitan cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen
    and Guangzhou) who are willing to spend their holidays and stay overnight (or
    even several nights) with their family members in the ancient town. The ancient
    town not only able to attract tourist from local but also foreign visitors. This
    paper focuses on the theme of high efficiency and energy savings and summarizes
    the creative realization work (by proper tailor of light rays and also careful
    colour selection) of the beautification and night landscape lighting of the Hui-style
    Ancient town in China- Jiuzi Ancient Town using high power LEDs. The night landscape
    lighting in Jiuzi Ancient town not only serves aesthetic value, economical value
    and environmental value on tourism, but also creates a primitive and quiet atmosphere
    at night and a perfect harmonization with the historical architecture. The key
    issues of this study work are the appropriate luminance distribution, luminance
    contrast, the smart use of colour to meet the aesthetics need of old ancient town,
    integrated application of LED lighting science and technology, creating comfortable
    and peace illuminated environment of old architectures, applying green lighting
    and controlling light pollution.
