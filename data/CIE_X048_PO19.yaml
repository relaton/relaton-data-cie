abstract:
- content: LED-based light sources have replaced massively traditional sources. The
    metrology traceability chains realised in leading European NMIs utilise the absolutely
    calibrated broadband radiometers (three-element silicon trap detectors) for calibrating
    primary photometers. Specific spectral properties of white LED allow to apply
    the trap detectors directly as new primary photometers. The unfiltered technique
    (Donsberg at al., 2014) is used and the calibration of spectral irradiance responsivity
    is needed. We have a long experience in detector-based spectral irradiance responsivity
    calibrations declared by particular CMCs published in BIPM KCDB. The aim of this
    work was to revise the uncertainty budget in order to reduce the measurement uncertainties
    for specific application of calibration of the trap-based unfiltered primary photometers
    UPP. The two calibration methods were used to analyse the occasional back-reflection
    effect of the UPP front aperture. The measurement was performed using our reference
    spectral responsivity facility in spectral range 350 nm - 900 nm.
