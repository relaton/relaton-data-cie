abstract:
- content: Recent studies on the influence of light on the human body have reported
    that various properties of light, such as illuminance and chromaticity, induce
    physiological and psychological effects on the human body when exposed to a light
    source. However, to date, these studies have focused only on chromaticity, while
    no research has been conducted on the effect of different illuminance levels on
    the human body at fixed chromaticity. This is partly because there is no experimental
    facility to control illuminance and chromaticity simultaneously. The significant
    effort involved in building an environment providing a variable illuminance and
    chromaticity also means that experiments cannot be performed efficiently. In this
    research, we use full-colour RGBY LED lighting, capable of adjusting each colour
    through a range of 1 000 digital signal values, and propose a method to rapidly
    implement arbitrary illuminance and chromaticity control.
