abstract:
- content: Bluer colour of luminous environment perceived by occupants increases circadian
    actionfactor that indicates the degree of effect on circadian rhythm, which affects
    suppression of melatonin hormone secretion. Suppression of melatonin hormone secretion
    causes adverse effects such as sleep disorder, melancholia and growth impairment.
    Therefore, to design appropriate human centric lighting, it would be desirable
    to provide lighting similar to daylight. The spectrum matching methodology proposed
    in previous studies offers monochromatic artificial lighting that resembles spectrum
    of daylight. If the methodology is applied to artificial luminous ceiling or artificial
    window lighting installed for communication with the outside without daylight,
    monochromatic light cannot be expected to give satisfactory communication effect
    for occupants even if its spectrum is same as daylight. Accordingly, this study
    developed a methodology for calculating combination ratio of multi LED chips matched
    with spectrum of daylight and embodying non-monochromatic real sky image for artificial
    luminous ceiling or artificial window lighting that can be applied to underground
    space, windowless space, submarine, and so in.
