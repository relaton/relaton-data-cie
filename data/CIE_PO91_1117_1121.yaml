abstract:
- content: This paper measures transmittance and scattering characteristics under
    adverse weather conditions. A weather chamber is used to generate different fog
    density and rain conditions. Collimated narrowband light source from monochromator
    illuminated by Xenon illuminator is used as a light source. Transmittance and
    scattering characteristics of each narrowband light source are measured. Experimental
    results show limited wavelength dependence of transmittance and scattering characteristics
    under fog and rain conditions.
