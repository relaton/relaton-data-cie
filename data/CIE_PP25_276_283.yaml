abstract:
- content: At present, the dimming systems of aircraft cockpit lighting are mainly
    manual. Manual dimming will increase the task burden of the pilot. This can be
    improved by introducing automatic dimming, which can adjust visual display terminal
    (VDT) and indicator lights into a comfortable luminance automatically according
    to ambient illuminance. Relationship between preferred luminance and ambient illuminance
    is required for automatic dimming. Two experiments were carried out to investigate
    the relationship between preferred luminance and ambient illuminance for VDT and
    indicator lights. It is found that when ambient illuminance increases, the preferred
    luminance of the VDT and indicator lights is higher, and it follows a relationship
    of power function. Two curves with mathematical expression were obtained by exploiting
    the data to cover the range of possible ambient illuminance in aircraft cockpit.
    The results of this study can provide empirical data for the automatic dimming
    system of aircraft cockpit.
