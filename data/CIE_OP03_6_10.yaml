abstract:
- content: An experiment was carried out to study the effects of lighting on children's
    work performance and eye fatigue in an office room. The lighting source was a
    11-chanel LED lighting system. There were 5 different lighting conditions. For
    CCTs, 3000 K, 4000 K, 5000 K were adopted, they were the most commonly used CCT
    in Chinese indoor lighting. There were two CS levels, a higher range of 0.107~0.140
    and a lower range of 0.033~0.045 at cornea level. Twelve junior school students
    participated the experiment. Work performance task including d2 test, reading,
    copying textbooks and finding. Eye fatigue was measured by CFF and NPA. The results
    show that children have higher alertness level under high CS lighting conditions.
    Higher CS lighting also make children get more eye fatigue. 4000 K can improve
    children's work performance.
