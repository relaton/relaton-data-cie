abstract:
- content: Virtual Reality (VR) seems a promising tool in lighting field, both for
    design and research applications. Despite several studies have been conducted
    on this topic, the opinions about the actual advantages of VR are conflicting.
    It is not clear if VR software are able to properly simulate spatial light distribution,
    and if the luminous sensation reproduced in Virtual Reality is representative
    of the real one. The paper revises the literature about the topic and then tests
    the reliability of a VR simulation software, Unreal Engine (UE), in calculating
    light. To do that, illuminance measurements were performed in a test room and
    the obtained values were compared with those calculated with both UE and DIVA
    for Rhinoceros. Results demonstrated that the percentage differences between the
    UEs and the real values range from -2% to 5% and those between UE and DIVA from
    -4% to 0%.
