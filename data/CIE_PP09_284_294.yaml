- content: We evaluated concentration on tasks to build psychophysically-based model
    of graininess perception for device independent graininess reproduction system.
    This model is developed by conducting the experiments to explore the relationship
    between physical parameters of the graininess objects in the subjective evaluation
    and values of maximum luminance on the display for reproduction. The graininess
    model obtained by multiple regression analysis for the above values can be used
    to calculate curved surfaces where the graininess objects are observed as the
    equal appearance. This surface can be used for device independent graininess reproduction
    process to match the graininess under the displays with various maximum luminance.
    On the other hand, we focus on the concentration on the experiment by subject.
    We measured heart rate variability by the electrocardiogram attached on the arm
    of the subject. We found that it is necessary to consider the concentration on
    the task to obtain the appropriate psychophysically based model.
