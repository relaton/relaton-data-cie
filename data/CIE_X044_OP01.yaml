abstract:
- content: Magnitude estimation experiments are performed to investigate the influence
    of the background luminance on the brightness perception of self-luminous stimuli.
    Twenty three observers assessed the brightness of one white and three coloured
    self-luminous stimuli seen against fifteen different self-luminous quasi-neutral
    backgrounds. The luminance level of the background varied between 0 cd/m2 and
    960 cd/m2. The central stimulus has a fixed luminance level of 125 cd/m2. As expected,
    for each stimulus, the brightness perception decreases when the background luminance
    increased. The average brightness perception can be fitted very well (Pearson
    r = 0.99 .and R2= 0.96) by a model based on the brightness prediction of the CAM15u
    model for unrelated colours, corrected for the impact of the selfluminous background.
