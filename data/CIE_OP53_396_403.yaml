    We measure the microtopography of three pre-existing grey matt samples with Coherence Scattering Interferometry. The high angular resolution BRDF of specular peaks from these samples is acquired using a goniospectrophotometer. A visual ranking of the samples according to their perceived gloss is established by naive observers. Crossing the results of these experiments, we remark the presence of a complex information embedded in the specular peak, that could be used as a cue in the construction of the glossy perception. The
    joint analysis of the bidimensional Fast-Fourier Transform of the roughness mappings and BRDF measurements is a promising path towards a better understanding of reflection upon complex surfaces.
