abstract:
- content: With the advent of LED lights and the added functionality of the lights
    themselves, the number of automobile headlights being manufactured is rising.
    Â Manufactured headlights need to be measured for light distribution characteristic
    to assure their quality. However, the conventional method requires a lot of measurement
    time and a large space. As a result, problems arise where light distribution measurement
    cannot be completed in time for headlight production. We propose a measurement
    method for complex light distribution characteristic based on light fields to
    solve this problem. Our method is to measure the light intensity of planes at
    a certain range distance from the light source and then estimate the light distribution
    characteristic of a light source. This method would enable the measurement of
    the light distribution characteristic in a narrower range and in a shorter time
    than the conventional method.
