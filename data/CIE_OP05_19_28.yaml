abstract:
- content: With tuneable LED lighting technology, 12 office lighting conditions was
    designed with 2 levels of correlated colour temperatures (CCTs) (4000 K, 6000
    K), 2 levels of illuminance levels (400 lx, 700 lx) and 3 levels of blue-light
    peak wavelengths (420 nm, 450 nm, 475 nm). Eye fatigues and task performances
    of 12 participants was analysed with variables of CCT, illuminance, blue-light
    peak wavelength, retinal blue-light hazard, and circadian radiometric quantities.
    The results indicated eye fatigues in 6000 K environments increases higher than
    4000 K, and in 700 lx environments increases higher than 400 lx. Task performances
    in 4000 K environments is better than 6000 K. The 400 lx / 4000 K office lighting
    is the best one within our test lighting conditions. Retinal blue-light hazard
    is more useful than circadian radiometric quantities and blue-light peak wavelength
    in office lighting evaluation. Besides CCT and illuminance, choosing a low retinal
    blue-light hazard spectrum may be a good strategy.
