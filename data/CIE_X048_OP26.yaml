abstract:
- content: Although daylight changes seen through windows are likely to mediate positive
    responses in occupants, there are no specialized instruments capturing responses
    to dynamic attributes in views. This study mapped self-report instruments that
    could be readily adjusted to measure subjective responses to dynamic views. Through
    a revision of the literature, 55 papers in view assessment were clustered as a
    function of prevalent label types and constructs used to investigate responses
    to static outdoor views. Feature-type was the prevalent label distinction to investigate
    responses to window views, whilst preference and restoration were the predominant
    constructs in view out research. Four instruments were deemed appropriate to capture
    responses to dynamic attributes in views with respect to restoration, provided
    that semantic adaptations and further validations are set in place. This study
    highlights the need for more validation studies to increase the robustness of
    self-report instruments and outlines a theoretical approach to achieve this scope.
