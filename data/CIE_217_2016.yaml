abstract:
- content: A method is recommended to evaluate the strength of the relationship between
    visually-perceived colour differences in a given set of colour pairs and their
    corresponding predictions made by a colour-difference formula. This method is
    based on the Standardized Residual Sum of Squares (STRESS) index used in multidimensional
    scaling, and tests if two colour-difference formulae are or are not statistically
    significantly different. The same index can be also used to compute intra- and
    inter-observer variability in visual experiments. Beside important advances made
    in the field of colour-difference evaluation using reliable visual datasets currently
    available, the results achieved from the STRESS index indicate that it is not
    possible to recommend a more uniform colour space with a Euclidean colour-difference
    formula that is statistically significantly better than CIEDE2000.
