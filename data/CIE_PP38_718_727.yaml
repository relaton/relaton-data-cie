abstract:
- content: Temporal light artefacts, abbreviated TLAs (including flicker, stroboscopic
    effect and phantom arrays), i.e. undesired time modulation in luminance from a
    light source, has shown to be a threat to wider SSL adoption especially related
    to dimming functions and low-quality LED products. This is due to the effects
    that both noticeable and unperceivable TLAs have on human perception and wellbeing.
    In the present work a number of filament LED bulbs, currently available on the
    market, are assessed primarily with respect to TLAs, but also with respect to
    photometric, colorimetric and efficiency properties. The investigation shows that
    only one of the 10 investigated lamps can be considered flicker free. The rest
    of the lamps the TLAs are of such a magnitude that none of them fulfil the suggested
    recommendations currently available.
