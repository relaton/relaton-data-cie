abstract:
- content: 'This study recorded physiological responses under LED and OLED light source
    while subjects executed tasks, and investigated whether physiological responses
    were affected by the light source. Three indices of physiological response that
    are sensitive to autonomic nerve were measured: nasal temperature, heartbeat,
    and brain wave. Results show that the change of the nasal temperature under LED
    during the task was significantly larger than that under OLED. This suggested
    that the stress caused by task may be reduced by changing the light source. We
    also examined whether these changes are due to differences in the spectral distribution
    of the light source. The results showed no change in physiological response under
    LED and OLED whose spectral distributions were identical.'
