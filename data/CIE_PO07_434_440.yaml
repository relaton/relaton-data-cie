abstract:
- content: In order to determine the lighting sources that can improve colour discrimination
    ability of subjects with protan and deutan, we performed a series of the test
    light of different correlated colour temperature (CCT) of daylight metamers and
    enhancing lights. Farnsworth D-15 colour vision test (D-15 test) was used in this
    study. The CCTs of daylight metamers were set from 2000 K to 7000 K. The combinations
    of spectral power distribution (SPD) of daylight metamers were the best performance
    of daylight metamers with red, yellow, green, and blue narrow-band colour lights.
    The experimental results showed that protan subjects performed better performances
    under 2000 K daylight metamer mixing with red or yellow coloured lights. Deutan
    subjects performed well under 2000 K daylight metamer mixing with yellow coloured
    lights.
