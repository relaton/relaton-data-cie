abstract:
- content: The rapid development of smart technologies for public street lighting
    has introduced new opportunities and complexities. By embedding communication
    systems into street lights, this commonplace infrastructure can facilitate the
    transfer of data in the era of Internet of Things. Nevertheless, the prospect
    of street lights providing revolutionary services can be overhyped without full
    clarification of the short and long term costs and risks. Globally, there is widespread
    uptake of LED luminaires for public street lighting, in virtue of energy efficiency
    and complementary functionality with smart technologies. The power quality concerns
    due to augmented total harmonic distortion must however be recognised. This paper
    aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of
    introducing new smart technologies into what must continue to be a robust, reliable
    public lighting network.
