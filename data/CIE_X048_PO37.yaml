abstract:
- content: Stray light from commercial greenhouses is becoming a significant problem
    causing disruption to wildlife activity and annoyance for local residents. To
    quantify the amount of stray light from a typical large greenhouse the authors
    have modelled several lighting installations based on a range of generic horticultural
    light sources. The impact of the stray light is dependent on the spectral power
    distribution of the sources employed, the intensity and distribution. Current
    standards for obtrusive light from outdoor work places do not seem to be suitable
    when applied to greenhouses.
