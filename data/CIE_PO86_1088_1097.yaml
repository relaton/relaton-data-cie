abstract:
- content: In a previous paper, the relevance of several discomfort glare predictors
    has been considered for pedestrian ratings (Villa et al., 2017). These results
    are extended here to the Unified Glare Ratio and the Cumulative Brightness Evaluation
    System, which do not predict a de Boer rating. Conversion scales are proposed
    to compare the mean subjective de Boer ratings with the predictions of these models.
    The UGR leads to a strong overestimation of the glare experienced by pedestrians,
    while further studies are needed in order to assess the usefulness of the CBE
    for pedestrian lighting.
