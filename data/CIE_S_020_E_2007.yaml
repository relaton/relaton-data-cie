    This standard specifies the luminous requirements for emergency lighting systems
    installed in premises or locations where such systems are required. It is principally
    applicable to locations where the public or workers have access. The primary
    objective of emergency lighting is the provision of visual conditions that can alleviate
    panic and facilitate safer evacuation of buildings occupants during the failure of
    normal power supply/lighting, in clear (non-smoke) and smoke filled conditions. The
    emergency lighting scheme design should be based on worst conditions (e.g.
    minimum light output, maximum glare limits) of the luminaires during operating life.

    The requirements given in this standard are a minimum for design purposes and are
    calculated for the full rated duration period and end of design life of the equipment. A
    special chapter for smoke is included. Safety signs may also fulfil further functions
    within maintained operation.
