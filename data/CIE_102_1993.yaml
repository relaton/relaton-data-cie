    1, 23-31, 1987. In order to calculate the light striking a surface or leaving
    that surface from one or a group of man made and installed luminaires, it is necessary
    to know the light intensity distribution at all spherical angles from each luminaire
    that contributes light to that surface. The advent of personal micro-computers
    has made it possible for each technical person to perform his own calculations
    using a suitable application program. It is common practice to record the light
    intensity at a large number of spherical angles from a specific luminaire (photometric
    data set) onto magnetic media, such as a computer disk. While the standardization
    of the size, shape and other technical features between disks and computers has
    been done by others, it is necessary for the computer program reading data from
    the disk to know the sequence of data being transmitted about the luminaire, light
    source, and angles at which the data has been recorded. This is termed the "file
    format". While many countries, and companies within countries, have already adopted
    a specific file format it is necessary to have an international file format so
    that the photometric data set specific to a particular country can be translated
    (by computer program) into the international file format; or that a photometric
    data set received in the international file format, can be translated (by computer
    program) into the specific file format used in a particular country or a specific
    application program developed by an individual or company. The CIE Recommended
    File Format is not intended to be used for manual calculations to determine the
    specific light intensity at a specific angle, but rather to be easily read, without
    error, into a computer program, either for translation into another format, or
    for calculation of the results of a lighting installation. The publication contains
    28 pages, with 4 figures. It is readily availabe from the National Committees
    of the CIE or the CIE Central Bureau in Vienna.
