abstract:
- content: Accurate wavelength calibration of array spectroradiometers is critical
    to many applications. We developed a new method for calibration of array spectroradiometers'
    wavelength scales using a wavelength-tunable kilohertz-pulsed optical parametric
    oscillator (OPO) laser and achieved a wavelength uncertainty on the level of picometers;
    a reduction of approximately two orders of magnitude compared to those using traditional
    methods. This high-accuracy wavelength calibration method can also be used to
    determine a spectroradiometer?s pixel-to-pixel wavelength interval with an uncertainty
    of a few picometers, which is the key to achieving small uncertainties when a
    detector-based method is used for spectral calibration of array spectroradiometers
    using tunable lasers. Using this calibration method can also significantly reduce
    the overall measurement uncertainties in various applications.
