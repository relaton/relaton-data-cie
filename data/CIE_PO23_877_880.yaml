abstract:
- content: We conducted a visual evaluation experiment of perceived whiteness under
    the illuminant D50 condition, which is normally used in graphic arts. As a result,
    whiteness was evaluated higher for the stimuli of higher bluish purity even in
    the region exceeding the applicable limit of the CIE whiteness formula. When the
    correlation between the visual evaluation results and the predicted values by
    each whiteness formula of CIE, Uchida, and Grum was discussed, it was found that
    the Uchida whiteness formula did not predict whiteness under the illuminant D50
    condition. The predicted values by the whiteness formulas of CIE and Grum correlated
    well with the visual evaluation results; however, it was considered that the Grum
    whiteness formula with no applicable limit is superior to the current CIE whiteness
    formula.
