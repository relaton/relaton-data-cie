    This CIE International Standard defines quality indices characterizing the performance
    of illuminance and luminance meters in a general lighting measurement situation, as
    well as measurement procedures for the individual indices and standard calibration
    conditions.
    Measurements of illuminance or luminance and their accuracy are influenced by
    various parameters, such as operational conditions, properties of light sources, as
    well as characteristics of the applied photometers. The characteristics of these
    photometers alone do not allow the determination of the measurement uncertainty for
    a specific measurement task. Nevertheless, it is generally true that instruments with
    "better" characteristics in most cases produce smaller uncertainties than instruments
    with "worse" properties. This Standard has been written to:

    give clear and unambiguous definitions for the individual quality indices;
    define measurement procedures and methods for numerical evaluation of these
    quality indices;
     define calibration conditions for illuminance meters and luminance meters.

    Where different, the definitions of the quality indices and the associated measurement
    procedures and methods for numerical evaluation given in this Standard supersede
    those given in CIE Publication 53-1982. CIE publication 69-1987 shall be superseded
    by this Standard.
