abstract:
- content: Study of Light Emitting Diode (LED) health lighting has been the key point
    of the development of LED industry. It is important to assess the visual fatigue
    of users in the LED lighting environment. Previous researchers tend to assess
    the visual fatigue degree of products based on subjective perceptions of the product
    users. Few credible indices are provided for quantification, making their results
    controversial in stability and accuracy. Consequently, these researching results
    can hardly meet the "human-centric" aim of lighting products design. In the present
    study, we showed an introduction to the system frame and researching progress
    of LED health lighting study based on visual physiological parameters.
