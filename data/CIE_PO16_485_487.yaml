abstract:
- content: According to the experience, the spectral energy of lights that transmitted
    under the seawater was decayed at different depths, as well as the spectrum absorption
    issue of underwater illumination is discussed and a wide range of topics are covered
    in the marine field. Therefore, colour compensation of white light LEDs for reducing
    the true colour of underwater illumination is necessary. In this paper, we consider
    common parameters of seawater, such as salinity, concentration, temperature, refractive
    index and so on, a seawater model can be established, and the spectral energy
    change of LEDs can be also simulated and analysed. The simulation results showed
    the highly positive relationship between spectral energy decay, extinction coefficient
    and Mie scattering of sea water.
