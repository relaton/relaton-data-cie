    Optical radiation can cause permanent damage to the colo ur of Chinese traditional paintings which are extremely high-responsivity in the museum illumination. In order to obtain quantitative influence rule of artificial illumination on Chinese traditional heavy colour
    paintings and provide basis for light source choice, there is a long periodic irradiation experiment carried out to examine how prolonged exposure of three light sources (tungsten halogen, metal halide and WLED (White Light Emitting Diodes)) frequently-used in museums affect the chromaticity of five pigments (azurite (cyan), cinnabar (red), orpiment (yellow), ancient graphite (black) , clam shell powder (white)) commonly used in Chinese traditional heavy colour paintings. By the methods of chromaticity parameter measurement and data analysis, the decay laws of colour change caused by different light sources are obtained, and the proportional relationship of three light sources influencing Chinese traditional heavy colour paintings are achieved.
