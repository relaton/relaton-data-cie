abstract:
- content: Light sources causing annoyance or pain produce discomfort glare. Traditional
    glare metrics are merely empirical and fail for non-uniform luminaires. By incorporating
    the centre-surround receptive field mechanism, the pupillary light reflex and
    a position index correction per pixel, a more physiologically justified model
    is developed. The centre-surround receptive field mechanism acts similar to an
    edge filter and represents the visual signal. The pupil area, influences the retinal
    illuminance. A correction according to the Guth position index accounts for the
    reduction in brightness perception when a light source is moved away from the
    line of sight. The model is analysed with a paired comparison experiment involving
    9 non-uniform rear projected stimuli with different spatial frequencies and luminance
    steps. With a coefficient of determination of 0.90, the model is a promising alternative
    to current glare metrics, especially when non-uniform luminaires are to be evaluated.
