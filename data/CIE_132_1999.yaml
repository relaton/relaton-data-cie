    Several recommendations and technical reports have been published over the past years by the CIE to provide calculation methods for designing road lighting installations, which satisfy certain quality criteria. These quality criteria are intended to ensure the safety, comfort and personal security of road users. These documents are often referred to in the national codes and recommendations of industrialised countries. The calculation methods necessitate the use of a computer.

    Experience shows that the high degree of accuracy obtained with the recommended methods of calculation is not always necessary, at least during the first stage of design. In some countries simplified methods have been developed which show similarities. They do not require a computer for application by the user.

    The aim of this report is to describe these and similar design methods for lighting installations for all categories of roads. The method to be used depends on the required accuracy and the type of data available to the designer.

    This publication is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It contains 56 pages, with 33 figures and 16 tables.
