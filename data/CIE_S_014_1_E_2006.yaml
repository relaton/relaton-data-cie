    This CIE Standard replaces ISO/CIE 10527:1991. This Standard contains only minor
    changes from the previous Standard, it has now been clarified that the values of the
    colour matching functions apply for standard air to make the Standard conform to
    other CIE photometric and colorimetric data.
    Colours with different spectral compositions can look alike. An important
    function of colorimetry is to determine whether a pair of such metameric colours will
    look alike. It has long been the practice in colorimetry to make use of sets of colourmatching
    functions to calculate tristimulus values for colours: equality of tristimulus
    values for a pair of colours indicates that the colour appearances of the two colours
    match, when they are viewed in the same conditions by an observer for whom the
    colour-matching functions apply. The use of standard sets of colour-matching
    functions makes the comparison of tristimulus values obtained at different times and
    locations possible.
    This International Standard specifies colour-matching functions for use in
    colorimetry. Two sets of colour-matching functions are specified:
    Colour-matching functions for the CIE 1931 standard colorimetric observer
    This set of colour-matching functions is representative of the colour-matching
    properties of observers with normal colour vision for visual field sizes of angular
    subtense from about 1° to about 4°, for vision at photopic levels of adaptation.
    Colour-matching functions for the CIE 1964 supplementary standard colorimetric
    observer.
    This set of colour-matching functions is representative of the colour-matching
    properties of observers with normal colour vision for visual field sizes of angular
    subtense greater than about 4°, for vision at sufficiently high photopic levels
    and with spectral power distributions such that no participation of the rod
    receptors of the retina is to be expected. The values in the tables of the colour matching functions and chromaticity coordinates of the CIE 1931 and 1964 standard colorimetric observers are identical
    with those in the previous standard.
