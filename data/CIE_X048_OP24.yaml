abstract:
- content: Seating that meets the needs and preferences of students can promote a
    longer stay in libraries and keep students motivated, which in turn influences
    their emotions and learning abilities. However, existing knowledge on the interaction
    between daylighting and seating preferences is limited. This study aims to understand
    what type of spaces are in more demand and the relationship between seat occupancy
    and daylight availability. Occupancy data of the UCL Bartlett library acquired
    from motion sensors located underneath each desk was used to assess occupancy,
    which was then compared to characteristics of space, including daylight availability.
    The study revealed that although daylight has a considerable impact on students
    seat selection, the seating preference of the students cannot be explained by
    daylight alone. The seats with a good combination of daylight, outdoor view and
    privacy are in more demand compared to seats that provide only a high level of
    daylight. Future research should involve individual perception in addition to
    occupancy monitoring data, considering daylight conditions together with other
    components such as privacy, outdoor views, and quietness.
