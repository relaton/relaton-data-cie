abstract:
- content: The economic value of cotton is very high as compared to the other natural
    fibres. And trading of cotton fibre is based on its precise grading on the basis
    of some important properties. Colour is one of those properties, which play a
    vital rule for the grading of cotton. Rd (degree of reflectance) and +b (yellowness)
    are the colour parameters of cotton fibre. These parameters are specific to the
    cotton colour measurement and not globally recognized. In this research, a new
    method (non-contact) is established to measure the colour of cotton fibre. And
    the results are compared with the HVI (High volume instrument) and with the spectrophotometer.
