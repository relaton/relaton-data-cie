abstract:
- content: This paper summarises the research work by the authors for the evaluation
    of glare (Yang et al., 2015, 2016a, 2016b 2017). Three experiments were carried
    out to accumulate glare perception data from luminaires having different uniformities
    and spectral power distributions. Two generic glare models were developed to fit
    the visual data in Experiments 1 and 2. Their performance were also tested using
    Experiment 3 data. They outperformed the UGR and the other state of the art models.
