abstract:
- content: In global agriculture and, in particular, in Russia the tendency of artificial
    lighting in greenhouses growth is clearly visible. Until recently most of greenhouses
    used irradiators with high pressure sodium lamps (HPS lamps). The photometric
    system of units and relevant meters (illuminance meters) were successful used
    for plants irradiation measurements. The advent of LED luminaires with different
    light spectra, including those that emit in the visible spectrum border regions
    (in blue and red bands), necessitated the introduction of PAR (photosynthetically
    active radiation) system into practice. This paper discusses the issues related
    to PAR measurements of PAR values such as PPF and PPFD.
