abstract:
- content: Dynamic colours are sensitive on different stimuli such as UV-VIS radiation,
    temperature, humidity, etc. Potential application of these systems in industry,
    fashion and other branches brings problem of its measurement for purpose of control
    their quality. For example photochromic colours need to be exposed by external
    light source during measurement.  Based on that the special device was developed
    allowing such kind of measurement. This unique device allows the measure colorimetric
    and spectral characteristics of colour changeable materials as photochromic sensors
    and also the fatigue test for the control of colour change stability. This measurement
    of colorimetric and spectral parameters in comparison together with intensity
    of UV irradiation allows finding the dependence of colour change on intensity
    of irradiation and the development the scale for individual visual observation
    and to evaluate dangerousness of UV irradiation. In this article is described
    possibility to use different light sources (Xe 450 W and LED 395-410) for this
    kind of measurement and also there influence of selected light sources on photochromic
    effect is discussed. Is evident, there is a problem for future standardization
    of colour changeable materials measurement.
