- content: "Please note:  English version is included in the case of purchasing a
    translation.\n          \n\n        Increasingly, UV-C (100 nm - 280 nm) mediated
    air disinfection (principally 254 nm radiant energy from low-pressure mercury
    lamps) is being used as a building environmental control to provide human protection
    from transmission of airborne pathogens such as tuberculosis bacteria, influenza
    viruses and other aerosolized agents. Some uses of UV-C energy require direct
    exposure of the volume room air in a horizontal plane directly above the heads
    of occupants. In these settings there is the potential of reflected or scattered
    UVC radiation that could result in human exposure. Known side effects of overexposure
    to UV-C radiation include transient corneal and conjunctival\nirritation (photo-keratoconjunctivitis)
    and skin irritation (erythema), which disappear within a 24 - 48 hour period,
    not currently known to produce lasting biological damage. The ACGIH and ICNIRP
    threshold limit for 8 hour continuous exposure to UV-C radiation at 254 nm is
    6 mJ*cm-2 (60 J*m-2), and proper installation of well engineered UV-C systems
    meet this criteria. However, there have been incidents of poor installations resulting
    in accidental UV-C overexposures. General statements that all UVR is carcinogenic
    have raised safety concerns of open air UV-C systems. Although, from basic biophysical
    principles, UV-C radiation is carcinogenic for the same reason that it is an effective
    germicidal agent, the attenuation provided by the stratum corneum and epithelial
    tissues of the skin greatly reduces the risk relative to UV-B radiation. UV germicidal
    irradiation can be safely and effectively used for upper air disinfection without
    a significant risk for long term delayed effects such as skin cancer."
