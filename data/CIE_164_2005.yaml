    CIE initiated a Technical Committee "Hollow Light Guides" for the purpose of developing new terminology and dissemination of information in the field of illumination with hollow light guides. This report is a first step in that direction, representing the state of the art at the time of its substantial completion in 1999.

    It includes a brief history of the field of hollow light guides, reviews the different solutions and describes the basic physics behind them. The pros and cons of each of the solutions are summarized and the terminology is given. System design and the photometry of hollow light guides are detailed. Finally, a review of four example projects is given.

    The report is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It consists of 37 pages with 13 figures and 6 tables.
