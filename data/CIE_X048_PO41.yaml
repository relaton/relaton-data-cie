abstract:
- content: The new HIEQ Lab (Health, well-being and Indoor Environmental Quality Laboratory)
    is presented. It is a living lab, primarily intended for research on human performance,
    comfort, and well-being, integrated with the energy performance in a completely
    controlled real space. Users are involved as active players in controlling and
    assessing building components and design strategies for health, well-being and
    IEQ requirements. Experimental activities will be addressed through a multi-domain
    approach that combines lighting, acoustic, air quality and thermal issues. For
    what concerns lighting, the laboratory is conceived to study the performance of
    daylighting and electric lighting systems and control solutions, focusing on the
    relationship between lighting conditions and human performance, comfort, and well-being.
    The paper reports the results of a literature review on existing lighting research
    facilities, and then describes the features of the new HIEQ Lab and its main research
    objectives, with a focus on lighting and daylighting research opportunities.Â
