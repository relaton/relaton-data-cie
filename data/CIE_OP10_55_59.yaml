abstract:
- content: 'A psychophysical experiment was conducted to study CCT uniformity on the
    work surface. The data were used to evaluate several uniformity metrics. Two attributes
    were scaled: uniformity and comfort using the categorical judgment method. Observers
    were asked to rate the attributes under different degree of CCT uniformity. The
    results showed that for light distribution with more uniform CCT, observers will
    feel more comfortable. The mired range performed better to evaluate the non-uniformity
    of CCT than CCT level. The uniformity of CCT is acceptable when mired range is
    smaller than 56 MK-1.'
