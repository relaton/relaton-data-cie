abstract:
- content: Discomfort glare metrics typically consider at least one of the two effects
    of discomfort glare - saturation and contrast - in their equation. The former
    occurs when there is an excessively bright glare source in the field of view,
    while the latter occurs when there is a high luminance ratio between the glare
    source and the adaptation level of the eye. We hypothesize that the contrast effect
    may dominate in low-light scenarios such as those commonly found in open-plan
    offices. Thus, we designed and carried out a user study in controlled laboratory
    conditions with 63 participants with a total of 252 scenes to investigate discomfort
    glare evaluations in dim daylight office environments with low adaptation levels.
    Our preliminary findings support our hypothesis that contrast-driven metrics predict
    glare responses in a more reliable way than hybrid metrics at low adaptation levels
    where the contrast effect dominates, which underlines the need for refining glare
    metrics in low brightness conditions.
