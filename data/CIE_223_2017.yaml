- content: 'This technical report describes the basic model of multispectral imaging
    technology followed by the requirements and the examples of multispectral image
    formats suitable for colour imaging applications. Four example formats are introduced
    and compared in typical use cases: JPEG 2000, Spectral Binary File Format, Natural
    Vision, and multispectral image file format AIX. The specifications of those formats
    except for JPEG 2000 are provided in the Annex.'
