abstract:
- content: The calculation of light distribution is usually made with ray-tracing
    based methods. These methods displays the interaction of light with matter at
    the interface between two media very well. Against that, the treatment of scattering
    in the volume with ray-tracing causes long computing time and is practically often
    solved with artificial interfaces which are replacing the volume. The latter is
    physically not exact, so we present an alternative method which is based on physical
    principles without using ray-tracing and with low computing time. We developed
    this method for glare evaluation in the traffic during fog and rain, but our method
    can be generally used for multiple scattering of any radiation in homogeneous,
    absorptive medium.
