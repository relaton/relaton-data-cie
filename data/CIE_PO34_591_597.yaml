abstract:
- content: CIE 157:2004 classifies museum collections into four groups according to
    different levels of light fastness. However, these classes were developed from
    research using traditional light sources. Even though LED technology is becoming
    more popular, there is no advanced evaluation of colour fading or colour change
    test for contemporary artworks. This study established that the CIE 157:2004 method,
    based on threshold effective radiant exposure, can be applied to an actual ageing
    test of UV-blocked light sources, including two types of white LEDs and one traditional
    halogen lamp. The results also present a colour fading model that can be used
    in museum LED lighting to predict colour differences of contemporary photographic
    materials for short- and long-term exhibition.
