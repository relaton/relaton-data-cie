    The laws of additivity and proportionality of colour matches, Grassmann's
    laws, are the basis of all colour theory, but are not axiomatically true. The
    extent of departure of human vision from Grassmann's laws has been
    periodically examined. One exploration, by W. A. Thornton, found
    considerable failure of transformability of primaries - a symptom of
    Grassmann additivity failure. In the 14 years since Thornton's finding, several
    groups have formed to replicate and understand Thornton's results and the
    limitations of Grassmann's laws. CIE TC 1-56 is the latest of these. During the
    ten years of this committee's existence, statistical simulations indicated that
    replicate matches by the same observer (not present in Thornton's data) are
    required to suppress random errors, and accordingly three laboratories
    generated intra-observer matching results in three different luminance
    domains. Two of the studies, respectively conducted at 300 cd*m-2 and
    30 cd*m-2, confirm Grassmann additivity, but the third study shows failure of
    additivity at 3 cd*m-2. In addition, Maxwell and maximum-saturation colour
    matches have long been known to be inconsistent even at high luminance
    levels and with intra-observer match replication to suppress noise. A practical
    consequence of the failure of additivity could be problems observed in crossmedia
    colour matching, although cross-media studies also have other well
    known sources of imprecision when the colour-matching is asymmetric. Some
    suggestions are made for a covering theory of Grassmann's laws that might
    accommodate both Maxwell and maximum-saturation match data while still
    maintaining consistency with high-luminance success in experiments such as
    reported recently. Further investigations are indicated for a successor to TC 1-
    56.
