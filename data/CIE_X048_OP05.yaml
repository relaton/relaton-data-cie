abstract:
- content: As the interest in design applications related to responses to light beyond
    vision is growing, two simulation tools, ALFA and Lark, have been developed to
    incorporate spectral characteristics of light in the evaluation of indoor lighting
    conditions. The spectral characteristics of light are of particular relevance
    when studying ipRGC-influenced responses. This paper aims to assess the reliability
    of these tools in predicting indoor spectral irradiance specifically from electric
    lighting. Spectral irradiance was measured under three indoor electric lighting
    scenarios and compared against spectral irradiance simulated in ALFA and Lark.
    While the outcomes of the study tend to show that ALFA is both more accurate and
    faster, rather large errors were found for spectral irradiance (-28.6% to 33.4%).
    In comparison to a prior study focusing on daylighting, these results seem to
    indicate that spectral simulations of electrically lit scenes are generally less
    accurate than those of daylit scenes with these tools.
