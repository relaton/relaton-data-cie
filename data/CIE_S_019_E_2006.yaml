    Solar ultraviolet radiation is recognized as a major cause of non-melanoma skin
    cancer in man. Skin cancer occurs most frequently in the most heavily exposed
    areas and correlates with degree of outdoor exposure. Describing the relationship of
    exposure (dose) to risk (skin cancer) requires the availability of a biological hazard
    function or action spectrum for photocarcinogenesis. This standard proposes the
    adoption of an action spectrum (weighting function) derived from experimental
    laboratory data and modified to estimate the non-melanoma tumor response in
    human skin. The experimental data are sufficient for estimating effectiveness down to
    about 250 nm, but experimental data are not sufficient for specifying effectiveness
    above 400 nm.
