    In March 2010 the Lighting Quality & Energy Efficiency Conference took place
    in Vienna, Austria. The event gave academics, lighting industry professionals,
    designers, researchers and representatives of regulatory authorities the
    opportunity to discuss best practice and the latest developments in the field of
    light and illumination. Recommendations were also made for reducing the
    amount of energy used for lighting. One of the hottest topics at the conference
    was light emitting diodes (LEDs), which offer significant environmental and
    energy-efficiency benefits compared with conventional light bulbs and energysaving
    lamps.
    The Proceedings of this Conference include invited papers and contributed
    papers as well as papers on the poster presentations.
