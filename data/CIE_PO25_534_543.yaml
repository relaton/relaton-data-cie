abstract:
- content: OST-HMD (optical see-through head-mounted display) is a kind of display
    device which is frequently used in mixed reality applications. In general, the
    virtual image would be nearly transparent when the virtual image is dark or the
    background scene is too bright. Especially for the second condition, if there
    is a glossy object in the scene and to be covered by a virtual object, the virtual
    object should be processed in order to enhance its visibility. To simulate the
    highlight condition, we generate background image with glossy objects in varying
    degrees and display these images on a 42" high dynamic range display. A psychophysical
    experiment was conducted to analyse the correlation between the scene and preferred
    rendering parameters.
