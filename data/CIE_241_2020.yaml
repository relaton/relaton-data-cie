abstract:
- content: CIE 241:2020 provides CIE recommended reference solar spectra for industrial
    applications. It contains a large selection of simulation benchmarks for total,
    direct and diffuse components of solar spectra under various atmospheric conditions
    and solar geometries (defined by the air mass). For this purpose a freely available
    solar spectral irradiance model has been used to generate tables and figures of
    solar spectral irradiance under a number of different atmospheric conditions,
    in the form of explicit meteorological input parameters. The data as provided
    in this document are to a large extent comparable to those in CIE 085-1989, but
    they are presented with a higher spectral sampling. The respective solar spectra
    are the basis for national and international standard reference spectra for various
    applications. They have been extensively validated against measured spectra.
