abstract:
- content: There are few methods to compare full luminous intensity distribution (LID).
    Current methods provide metric of the distance between LIDs but their formulation
    does not define an exact limit than can be considered acceptable in order to evaluate
    if two LIDs are the same luminaire. In this work, we propose a method in which
    we include uncertainty as a perturbation of the data. As a main result, we use
    a Monte Carlo Method in order to define an accepting interval to determine whether
    two LIDs can be considered different measures of the same luminaire.
