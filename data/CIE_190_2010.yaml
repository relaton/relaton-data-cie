    This report has been prepared to assist luminaire suppliers and lighting designers in
    the production of UGR tables for luminaires in preset arrays at 1:1 spacing to height
    ratio. This data is needed for the verification of conformity to the limiting UGR by the
    UGR tabular method specified in clause 6.2 of the Standard ISO 8995-1:2002(E)/
    CIE S 008/E:2001 "Lighting of Workplaces - Part 1: Indoor". The limiting UGR values
    are recommended in clause 5 of this standard. The report makes use of the basic
    UGR equation, described in CIE 117-1995, gives tables of preset values for the
    standard conditions and in step by step describes the calculation process needed to
    generate the uncorrected UGR table. The process is further demonstrated by a
    worked example of UGR calculation for a disymmetric distribution luminaire in a room
    2H x 4H. The report also gives the uncorrected UGR table for this luminaire which
    can be used to validate software designed for the production of the UGR table.
