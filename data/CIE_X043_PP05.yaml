abstract:
- content: In order to develop suitable light sources for disaster medical work, we
    first determined the skin colour and spectral reflectance of injured or sick persons
    under shocked or congested state. Using the NIST Color Quality Scale (CQS) simulation
    model, we theoretically determined appropriate spectral power distributions (SPD)
    of a light source which is effective in distinguishing colour differences among
    various skin states. Moreover, in order to evaluate the colour rendering, a subjective
    qualitative evaluation was conducted with similar SPD lights as the theoretical
    SPDs in NIST Spectrally Tunable Lighting Facility.
