    Technical Report, developed by TC 1-90, is a research report describing a general colour
    fidelity index, Rf, as a scientifically accurate measure of colour fidelity with respect to a
    reference illuminant. The important improvements of this measure, relative to the current
    colour rendering index, are the update of the colour difference calculation, in particular the
    object colour space, and the incorporation of 99 test-colour samples which provide a more
    uniform distribution of slope and curvature values as a function of wavelength and which have
    colour appearance values that are more widely and uniformly distributed in the three
    dimensions of a uniform colour space. However, Rf is not a replacement of the general colour
    rendering index, Ra, neither for the purpose of rating and specification of products nor for
    regulatory or other minimum performance requirements. Finally, relations of Rf to Ra and to
    luminous efficiency are discussed.
