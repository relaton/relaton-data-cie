abstract:
- content: Lighting parameters greatly affect the purchasing behaviour of the consumer
    by visual stimuli. The paper deals with a research of the influence of age and
    gender on surface material of commodity in commercial refrigerator using white
    LED lights. LED lights at various CCTs and illuminance intensities and three surface
    materials (metal, paper, and plastic) were used. Observers of two age groups (young
    and elderly) and two gender groups (male and female) participated in the study.
    The experimental results show that for the effect on surface material of commodity
    with the white LED lights, no significant difference was found in visual perception.
    For the effect of age, no significant difference was found in visual perception.
    Additionally, a strong gender effect was found for various surface material of
    commodity, especially freshness and attractiveness of visual perception. The outcomes
    of this field study can be helpful for wisely using LED luminaires in commercial
    refrigerator by considering both energy efficiency and satisfaction of visual
    perception.
