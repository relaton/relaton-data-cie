abstract:
- content: This paper provides the description of new colour rendition properties,
    for characterizing whitelight sources, which can be used in conjunction with the
    general colour rendering index, Ra. It presents the content of the Enquiry Draft
    / Technical Note (ED/TN) that was prepared as output of Reporter DR 1-68 "A Gamut
    Area Measure and Colour-shift Graphic, based on CIE 13.3-1995". The ED/TN included
    a CRI-based colour gamut index, Ga, and a colour-shift graphic as well as chroma
    indices and hue-angle changes for all individual test-colour samples (TCS). The
    described properties address the short-term needs of the lighting industry and
    can be used until the CIE has published an improved, globally accepted, multi-index
    method. This paper also presents the influence of Ga and the chroma index for
    the strong red TCS (#9) on the appreciation of spectrally-tuned white-light sources,
    with varying Ra and Ga values, for the illumination of three application areas.
