abstract:
- content: To validate the instrumental measurement of sparkle by the BYK-mac multi-angle
    spectrophotometer, the correlation between the sparkle magnitude assigned by observers
    and the sparkle magnitude calculated by the instrument was studied by using a
    psychophysical experiment. The method used for the visual assessment was the method
    of magnitude estimation. Observers were asked to assign numbers in proportion
    to the magnitude of a stimulus taking into account two references (extreme anchors).
    It was found that sparkle grade (SG) correlates very well with human visual perception.
    The performance is slightly better for 15째as15째 measurement geometry than for
    45째as45째 measurement geometry. However, sparkle intensity (Si) and sparkle area
    (Sa) do not correlate well with visual perception for any measurement geometry.
    It could be because the psychophysical experiment was designed to evaluate the
    sparkle grade and not to evaluate the two independent variables, although relevant
    for the final sparkle value.
