    During the life of a lighting installation, the light available progressively decreases. The reduction rates are a function of environmental, operating and age conditions. In lighting design we must take account of this fall by the use of a maintenance factor and plan suitable maintenance schedules to limit the decay. This guide provides information on suggested maintenance factors and the selection of suitable equipment. It describes the parameters influencing the depreciation process and develops the procedure for estimating the economic maintenance cycles for outdoor electric lighting installations and gives advice on servicing techniques.

    The Report is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It consists of 21 pages with 1 figure and 4 tables.
