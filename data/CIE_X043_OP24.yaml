abstract:
- content: BRDFs are commonly used for material appearance representation in applications
    ranging from gaming and the movie industry, to product design and specification.
    Most applications rely on isotropic BRDFs due to their better availability as
    a result of their easier acquisition process. On the other hand, anisotropic BRDF
    due to their structure-dependent anisotropic highlights, are more challenging
    to measure and process. This paper describes approaches to BRDF analysis and acquisition
    using ellipsoidal and parabolic reflectors commonly used for in illumination industry.
    First, we show how reflectors can be used for detection of anisotropic properties
    as anisotropic axes and highlight width. Second, we outline and approach for anisotropic
    BRDF capture using reflector that allows fast and convenient measurement without
    need of measured sample extraction.
