    This technical report is one of a series of supporting documents to CIE 12.2-1977  Recommendations for the Lighting of Roads for Motorized Traffic. It is concerned with the data involved in predicting the performance of an installation, as described in CIE 30.2-1982 Calculation and Measurement of Luminance and Illuminance in Road Lighting.

       1. Part 1 of the report describes

          the preferred form of basic photometric data for road lighting lanterns: intensity tables; isocandela diagrams; polar diagrams; flashed areas.
       2. Part 2 outlines

          additional derived data for an individual lantern which could be of value: description of a lantern in terms of throw, speed and control; utilization factor diagrams; luminance yield diagrams, isoluminance diagrams.
       3. Part 3 gives

          three useful methods of presenting data on the performance of lantern installations: performance tables; performance graphs; layout tables for achieving a specific performance.
       4. An Appendix gives
     information about differences in performance which have been found between installations using lanterns that satisfy the same specification or classification.

    The publication contains 39 pages, 15 figures and 1 table.
