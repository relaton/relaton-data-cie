abstract:
- content: The effects of goniochromatism and sparkle are reaching more and more interest
    for surface refinement applications driven by demanding requirements from such
    different branches as automotive, cosmetics, printing and packaging industry.
    In order to assure a proper characterization of textures with special-effect pigments,
    a commercial device has been developed to characterize the sparkle texture effect
    in different geometries, which is called BYK-mac multiangle-spectrophotometer.
    On the other hand, recently it has been published a method for calculating the
    sparkle descriptors of effect coatings from bidirectional imaging-based measurements.
    The main objective of this work is to check whether there is a visual, instrumental
    and structural correlation between the sparkle texture effect that the observer
    detects, the pigment concentration and the sparkle descriptors provided by both
    BYK-mac and those recently defined.
