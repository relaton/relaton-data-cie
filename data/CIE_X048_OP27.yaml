abstract:
- content: We developed a facility for calibration of TLM (temporal light modulation)
    photometers. The facility is based on a laser-fed reference source, of which the
    radiance can be modulated with an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). A system of photodiodes,
    amplifiers, and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is used to sample the temporally
    modulated radiance of the source. With the facility a TLM photometer was calibrated
    for display contrast ratio RMS (root mean square) with an absolute combined standard
    uncertainty of 0,037 %. In addition, the facility has been characterised with
    the aim of measuring flicker and stroboscopic effect, considering the Ecodesign
    Single Lighting Regulation. The frequency response of the facility shows to be
    sufficient to accommodate measurements of flicker and the stroboscopic effect.
