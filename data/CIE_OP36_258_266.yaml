    The study is conducted as a step in an interdisciplinary research project that aims to develop definitions of quality of light based on the visual and emotional aspects of light experience. The project is implemented in cooperation between Lund University in Sweden, Research Institutes of Sweden and companies within the lighting and the real estate business. The purpose of the sub study is to develop a typology of lighting quality in spatial context based on our knowledge of visual perception and practitioner?s principles of qualitative lighting
    design. The study results in a systematic visualization of different combinations of light and colour which illustrate the effects on both the perceived contrast ratio and the experience of a light environment. The typology can be used as a tool for visual evaluation of light quality, both in research and practice to complement photometric measurements.
