abstract:
- content: This document provides guidance on methods for computing and communicating
    colour gamuts for output colour reproduction systems such as printers and displays.
    Different methods for defining a colour gamut boundary are reported. A procedure
    for describing the colour gamut of a reproduction system is explained. A step-by-step
    method for calculating the volume of colour gamut is provided along with the colour
    gamut metrics for comparing two colour gamuts.The document describes methods for
    visualization of a 3D colour gamut surface. A set of information required for
    reporting a colour gamut has been developed. Different methods of encoding a colour
    gamut boundary description are mentioned. Examples for the CxF-based encoding
    of colour gamut boundary descriptors are provided as electronic attachments to
    this document.
