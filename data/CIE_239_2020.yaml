abstract:
- content: CIE 239:2020 provides basic measurement principles and practical guidance
    in goniospectroradiometry of optical radiation sources (i.e. measurement of the
    spectral distribution as a function of the emission angle of the source). Specifically,
    it includes measurement principles of the angular distribution of spectral, radiometric,
    photometric and colorimetric quantities of optical radiation sources, the related
    scanning method and a practical guide to determine sampling interval, uncertainty
    aspects and calibration.
