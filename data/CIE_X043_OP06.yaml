abstract:
- content: To characterize the polarization influence in diffuse reflectance measurements,
    PTB's gonioreflectometer has been equipped with a polarization-analyzer unit.
    This allows one to characterize the polarization state of light by measuring the
    Stokes parameters. Different kinds of samples have been investigated in several
    exemplary geometries (in plane and out of plane) and at different wavelengths
    to assess the influence of polarization. Among these samples are a ceramic white
    standard, semi-matte photo papers and different special-effect pigment coated
    tiles. The observed polarization effect strongly depends on the sample and on
    the geometry. For the samples in this study, the more sophisticated the optical
    properties of the sample are (color, gloss, texture, goniochromatism), the larger
    is the polarization effect, even for typical geometries.
