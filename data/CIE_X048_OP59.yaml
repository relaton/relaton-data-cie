abstract:
- content: The higher the colour fidelity of a light source, the lower its luminous
    efficacy of radiation because the light source spectrum must deviate from V(A)
    to deliver the higher fidelity. Two experiments probed the trade-off between energy
    efficiency and colour quality. Experiment 1 required participants to simultaneously
    view pairs of light sources differing in colour fidelity, at either a higher (346
    lx) or lower (277 lx) illuminance. Participants performed a timed reading task
    and judged the colour appearance of the pair. There were no effects of illuminance,
    but larger colour fidelity differences between the light sources in the pair correlated
    with lower appearance judgements. Experiment 2 simulated the effect of light sources
    on defined reflectance spectra. The results showed that improvements of colour
    fidelity above what is often considered satisfactory can yield more satisfying
    illumination while using the same amount of power.
