abstract:
- content: Two novel criteria capable of assessing spectral similarity and modelling
    plausibility of synthetic Bidirectional Texture Functions (BTF), static colours
    textures are presented. The criteria credibly compare their spectral contents.
    Their primary aim is to support optimal modelling algorithms and  measurement
    setup development by comparing the originally measured target texture with its
    synthetic simulations. The suggested spectral similarity criteria are extensively
    tested on measured natural BTF textures and an artificial distinctly coloured
    texture, and favourably compared with several alternative spectral similarity
    criteria. The performance quality of the proposed criteria is demonstrated on
    a long series of specially designed monotonically spectrally degrading experiments.
