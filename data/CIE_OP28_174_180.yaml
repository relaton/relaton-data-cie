abstract:
- content: 'This paper focused on the effects of colour temperatures on young people
    in resting state, especially for physiological index such as heart rate, blood
    pressure and electroencephalograph (EEG). Twelve young people were recruited as
    subjects aged from 21 to 25. This experiment had three correlated colour temperatures
    as 2700 K, 4000 K and 6500 K, with the same illuminance of 50 lx at eye level.
    Experiment results showed that: 1) Young people were more likely to choose low
    colour temperature and neutral white when they relaxed. 2) Heart rate, and blood
    pressure didn''t show significant interaction with colour temperature when illuminance
    is insufficient. 3) Alpha wave decreased in resting state. 4000 K and 6500 K had
    similar reduction of alpha wave, while 2700 K gave greater reduction of alpha
    wave value. 4) EEG signal in resting state was higher and more unstable for people
    with depression or bad sleep quality.'
