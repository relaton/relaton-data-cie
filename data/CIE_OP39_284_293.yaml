abstract:
- content: Designing a road lighting installation without the knowledge of the reflective
    properties of the road surface can lead to incorrect luminance levels and distributions,
    which in turn may cause lower safety and/or energy efficiency. The standard measurement
    method to determine the reflective properties of road surfaces, the r-tables,
    is not required by standards and rarely used. Other, non-destructive in situ measurement
    methods have not been asserted themselves. Cheap, easy and non-destructive methods
    are desired. Hence, the authors are investigating a method where luminance image
    processing is used to calculate reflective properties of street lighting scenes.
    With the help of a calibrated additional luminaire and several luminance images
    the reduced luminance coefficients in all relevant points of the measurement field
    are calculated and interpolated to the standard r-table format. With them, simulations
    in Radiance are made and compared to other simulations where precise measured
    r-tables and measurements were available.
