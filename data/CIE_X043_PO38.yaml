abstract:
- content: In memory matching techniques, it is well known that the retrieved colour
    might differ from the original colour even if the viewing conditions are the same.
    This paper investigates the influence of the memory effects on the material perception
    of gold by three psychophysical experiments. As the results, we found that appropriate
    luminance modulation was an important factor to perceive a high fidelity gold
    image. The luminance deviation was enhanced in the memory effect and Gaussian
    modulation and contrast enhancement were effective for high-fidelity image reproduction
    of 2D and 3D gold objects, respectively. We also suggested that colour shifts
    also occurred with the metallic gold objects, and the memory effect with the greatest
    advantage of luminance enhancement and saturation shift, depended on the participant.
