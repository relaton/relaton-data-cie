abstract:
- content: 'The technology of architecture daylighting design method, especially computational
    simulation method, has been developing quickly. Computational simulation software
    are currently the most widely used software for architecture daylighting design.
    The accuracy of computational simulation is limited when applied on long-span
    space public buildings, especially those are used for long hours, e.g. airport
    terminal. This study present an experiment that verify the accuracy of computational
    simulation method applied to one of the long-span spaces: airport terminal. In
    this study, both simulation and on-site measurement were taken for comparison.
    Experiment result (87 % relative error larger than 25 % in all data) shows that
    using the simulation software (Autodesk Ecotect Analysis® and Radiance®) for the
    lighting design of airport buildings is not accurate enough. To further improve
    the accuracy of simulation on daylighting design, artificial sky as a physical
    simulation tool used to simulate skylight has been showing great potential for
    development.'
