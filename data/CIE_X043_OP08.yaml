abstract:
- content: To progress toward the metrology of coloured and textured surfaces, validation
    criteria are required. In this work, we use the complexity assessment as an accuracy
    measure of texture features. We show how to transform a colour texture feature
    in a multiscale measure in order to assess the fractal dimension of colour surfaces.
    The feature accuracy is then estimated from surfaces with known fractal dimension
    using adapted midpoint displacement algorithm. The results show that the used
    vector texture feature (colour contrast occurrence) presents a good accuracy,
    but also that the colour midpoint algorithm must be improved to avoid artefacts
    in the generation of images with low complexity level.
