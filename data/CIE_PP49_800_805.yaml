abstract:
- content: 'Since CIE published Technical Report "196-2011: Guide to Increasing Accessibility
    in Light and Lighting", research work has been done on lighting and basic visual
    performance. However, more empirical evidence regarding daily activities of the
    elderly is still in need. The effect of LED lighting on the performance of daily
    activity for the elderly with age-related visual impairment has been investigated
    in controlled laboratory-based environment. The results suggested that both illuminance
    and SPD affect the performance of the three designed daily visual tasks: unlocking,
    character searching and colour identification. In unlocking task, for which central
    vision is required to see the details of key and keyhole, the task performance
    is largely affected by illuminance level. However, in colour identification task,
    SPD is the dominating factor for task performance. Regarding environmental compensation,
    illuminance is prior in visual task which required central vision while SPD is
    prior in colour vision.'
