abstract:
- content: Optical radiation causes permanent damage to the colour of Chinese traditional
    paintings. To establish the influencing rules of different light sources on traditional
    paintings and to determine the minimum damage light source of different types
    of traditional paintings, this study utilized a white light emitting diode (WLED)
    as experimental light source, a metal halide lamp, and a tungsten halogen lamp
    as contrast light sources to illuminate Chinese paintings, periodically measuring
    CIELAB colour data. First, we calculated the colour difference based on the data
    and plotted colour difference against exposure. Then, we plotted fitting curves
    of colour difference against exposure for four pigments, and obtained the relative
    influence coefficient of different light sources on four organic pigments via
    analysing the regression equation. These results provide a reference for choosing
    light sources in the design of museum lighting.
