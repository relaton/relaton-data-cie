abstract:
- content: "Since the appearance of the ISO publication \"Guide to the expression
    of uncertainties in measurement\" (GUM), in 1993, many practitioners in metrology
    have realised its limitations already indicated in the guide. The guide was intended
    for general use, special requirements like that of radiometry, propagation of
    distributions, multiple output, etc. are not met by it. Therefore, CIE dedicated
    its 2001 Symposium to this hot topic and held a symposium at the CIE Central Bureau,
    Vienna, Austria, on the 23 and 24 January 2001.\n\nTwo sections were organized:\n\n\n•Advances
    in Uncertainty Evaluation\n•Key Comparisons and the Mutual Recognition Arrangement.
    \n\nPapers in the first section used mainly theoretical approach to uncertainty
    and among others dealt with uncertainties of quantities derived from spectral
    sums, with numerical methods in colorimetry, with uncertainties in models having
    more than one output quantity, with correlations in photometric measurements and
    with GUM supplements. The second section was based on the practical implementation
    of photometric and radiometric measurements mainly in the frame of key comparisons.
    Papers were read on the BIPM key comparison database, on the objectivity of key
    comparison reference values, on heuristic and optimal estimators in photon counting
    and on the evaluation of photometric measurements in different national measurement
    laboratories.\n\nThe Proceedings contain on 83 pages the text of the nine papers
    read as well as reports on the discussions."
