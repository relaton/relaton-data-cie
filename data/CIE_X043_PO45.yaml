abstract:
- content: The complexity notion is shared between scientific fields associated to
    vision or surface assessment, especially non-uniform surfaces. Nevertheless, there
    is no single definition allowing comparing experimentally the perception induced
    by observing a colour textured surface, the measure extracted from the existing
    metrological tools or from image processing approaches. Among the existing definitions,
    entropy is often used as a measure directly correlated to the surface complexity.
    The fractal dimension associated to the auto-similarity property is well adapted
    for mathematical developments in image analysis and corresponds for some natural
    structures to the inner organization on several analysis scales. In the context
    of CIE TC 8-14 dedicated to the definition and assessment of the spatio-chromatic
    complexity, we are interested by the theoretical and experimental comparison of
    different ways to assess the complexity of colour textured surfaces. In this work,
    we compare the entropy against the fractal dimension for computer-generated fractal
    surface images.
