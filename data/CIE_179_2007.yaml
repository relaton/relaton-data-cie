abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this technical report is to provide an objective means
    for evaluating the properties of tristimulus colorimeter heads that are to be
    used to measure the colour of light sources. Several properties that determine
    the performance of tristimulus colorimeters can be quantified by numerical assessments.
    There are some properties, however, which have not been possible to quantify,
    where only a qualitative description is possible. Several sources of measurement
    error are also described. \n\nThe report is intended to serve as a guide for a
    potential user who wishes to make colour measurements of sources using a tristimulus
    colorimeter, and for manufacturers or users of instruments who need to specify
    or assess the quality of these instruments. The factors that make up the evaluation
    may also serve as a guide to manufacturers in the development of improved colorimetric
    instruments."
