abstract:
- content: Field measurement of TLM quantities in lighting scenarios is quite different
    from the laboratory measurement, including test environment, main supply and etc.
    In this paper, the influence of measurement position will be discussed based on
    the measurement of spatial distribution of TLM quantities. Besides, the influence
    of voltage fluctuation and harmonic components will also be analyzed. These will
    help to evaluate the uncertainty of field measurement of TLM quantities in lighting
    scenarios.
