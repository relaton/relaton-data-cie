abstract:
- content: For a long time, near-infrared radiation (NIR) has seemed, from the perspective
    of illuminating engineering, to be both useless and harmless. For this reason,
    it has been largely ignored, and considered to be merely a wasteful by-product
    produced by some light sources. Two recent developments suggest it may be time
    to reconsider this. First, medical researchers have determined that NIR can be
    effective in treating certain diseases, primarily through absorption by the important
    metabolic enzyme cytochrome c oxidase. This raises the possibility that NIR, which
    is abundant in natural light, may be actually be healthful. The second development
    is that the average exposure of people to NIR is dropping through ongoing replacement
    of NIR-rich incandescent lamps by LED lamps that have been carefully engineered
    to emit very little NIR light. Here we argue that there is a need for careful
    studies to check whether NIR can and should beneficially contribute to health.
