abstract:
- content: Mesopic vision is an important vision state that needs to be studied, a
    number of scenes, such as roads in the night, tunnels, are in the mesopic vision
    luminance range. Although a lot of studies have been conducted under mesopic vision
    in recent years, most studies are  about photometric performance, which means
    only a few studies are concerned with colorimetric performance under mesopic vision.
    Both photometric and colorimetric performance are important and interrelated for
    light sources, and their performance under mesopic vision would be different.
    However, it remains uncertain to what extend the colorimetric performance was
    influenced under the mesopic vison state. In this study, we try to find out how
    the purity feeling of colours changes with varying luminance under mesopic vision.
    Moreover, this study could provide some guidance on colour perception trend in
    the mesopic vision.
