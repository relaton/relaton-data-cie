abstract:
- content: In environmental terms, culture represents the climatic and indoor conditions
    people have experienced during a significant part of their life. Consequently,
    people exposed to different cultures might have different expectations of the
    lighting environment. Knowing the lighting expectations due to cultural experiences
    have numerous advantages; it could help meet the occupants needs and preferences
    and provide occupant satisfaction, reducing unnecessary energy consumption in
    the built environment. This paper aims to summarise a systematic review to create
    a conceptual framework of cultural background in the lit environment, which could
    help understand the impact of cultural background on daylight perception and expectation.
    This review highlighted that cultural background in lighting environment should
    be evaluated considering (1) the ethnicity and/or physiological characteristics
    of the individual eyes, (2) the area (luminance environment) where people used
    to live (3) the luminance environment they were recently exposed to and (4) the
    socio-cultural background of individuals. Future research should further test
    these components together and separately to investigate which component or combination
    is more influential on daylight perception.
