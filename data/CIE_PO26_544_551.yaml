abstract:
- content: In this paper, we propose a novel noncontact pulse wave monitoring method
    that is robust to fluctuations in illumination through use of two-band infrared
    video signals. Because the proposed method uses infrared light for illumination,
    the method can be used to detect a pulse wave on a human face without visible
    lighting. The pixel values in the region of interest (ROI) were spatially averaged
    over all the pixels of each frame. These averaged values were then used to form
    the raw trace signal. Finally, the pulse wave and the corresponding pulse rate
    were obtained from the raw trace signal through several signal processing stages,
    including detrending, use of an adaptive bandpass filter, and peak detection.
    In the experiments, we found that the performance of the proposed method was greatly
    improved compared with that of conventional methods using single-band infrared
    video.
