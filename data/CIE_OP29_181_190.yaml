abstract:
- content: Two thirds of the low vision population are over the age of 50 and were
    not concerned by any visual deficiency when they were younger. The predominant
    concerns of the largest part of such a population are the loss of independence
    and the ability to perform simple activities of everyday life. With a clear lack
    of efficient visual aids, one urgent challenge is to design and to develop new
    approaches to facilitate the vision rehabilitation, the mobility and the socioeconomic
    independence of people that have to face a visual impairment inducing major changes
    in their life. Within this framework, we investigated the influence of lighting-based
    edge enhancement techniques on the autonomous mobility of visually impaired people.
