abstract:
- content: BRDF measurement facility based on a gonioreflectometer calibrated against
    spectral diffuse reflectance standard has been developed at NMIJ. In addition
    to a versatile feature of the gonioreflectometer whose setup can be extend for
    various types of measurement setup related to reflectance colorimetry, an alternative
    BRDF measurement procedure based on spectral diffuse reflectance has been introduced
    to substitute direct comparison between the incident radiant flux on a sample
    and the reflected radiant flux from the sample at a specified direction which
    conventional BRDF measurement applies. The instrumental setup and measurement
    procedure have been outlined together with some experimental results and validation.
