abstract:
- content: Nepal houses several architecturally and culturally rich heritage sites
    and monuments. These sites are recognised globally and are of immense importance
    to the local and worldwide audience. The majority were constructed during the
    15th to 18th century and were designed to incorporate oil or fat-based wick lamps
    for lighting. The intervention of modern electric lighting in these structures
    should be carried out without conceding cultural values, visual perception, and
    traditional outlook. However, in most sites, there are no lighting or unscientific
    lighting interventions which are inappropriate, unsurpassed, exaggerated, and
    unpleasant. The light source spectrum is an essential factor in enhancing the
    natural appearance, increasing luminance, reducing degradation of artefacts by
    photochemical action, and reducing power consumption. The study aims to characterise
    the white light spectrum for its appropriateness to enhance the optical parameters
    by observing the spectral reflectance of the building materials of these sites.
    The experiment uses RGB tunes LED light source to obtain white light of different
    SPD and CCT. Building materials from Bhaktapur Durbar Square and Tripureshwor
    Mahadev temple and light SPD with CCT in the range of 1735 to 7669 K were used
    for the study. The study thus makes recommendations for an appropriate spectrum
    of light sources for Nepals heritage sites and monuments based on the experimental
    findings.Â
