abstract:
- content: The aim of this study is to optimize white LED spectrum based on 3D colour
    gamut under mesopic viewing conditions. Theoretical simulations show that the
    the spectrum power distribution (SPD) and luminance level obviously affect the
    luminous efficiency and the range of 3D colour gamut. Some optimal white LED spectra
    with higher mesopic luminance and wider colour gamut were tested psychophysically
    and the results confirm that the optimal white LED spectra could enhance visual
    brightness and colourfulness compared to typical cool and warm white LEDs at lower
    luminance levels.
