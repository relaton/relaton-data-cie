abstract:
- content: 'Head Mounted Displays (HMD) allows immersive experiences in virtual worlds
    and it would be expected to have many applications, in both fields: recreational
    and professional. The aim of this paper is to check the accuracy of the visual
    appearance of real objects captured through a 3D scanner, rendered in a PC and
    displayed in the latest development kit available of the Oculus Rift Virtual Reality
    glasses. Subjective evaluation has been carried out in both environments, real
    and virtual. Ten observers through a survey based on a 5 steps Mean Opinion Score
    scale. The results indicate greater fidelity in the lighting and shading using
    the deferred renderer that includes the BRDF model. For colour and texture, the
    results are slightly worse, but can still be considered acceptable. The worst
    results were obtained regarding the pixelation effect and correction for chromatic
    aberration.'
