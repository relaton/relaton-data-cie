abstract:
- content: With the attention currently on Temporal Light Artefacts (TLAs), another
    mechanism for the health effects of flicker above visually perceptible frequencies
    has been put forward. Non-visual and visual markers of performance have been shown
    to be affected above the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF) for visibility of flicker.
    Nevertheless, attempts to explore this have almost exclusively focused on TLAs,
    i.e. solely on visual effects. After considering the transduction mechanisms whereby
    flicker signals meaningfully enters the human body, and showing that this must
    logically occur above the CFF and does not rely on TLAs, a protection regime is
    proposed based on the percent flicker of the raw modulation after appropriate
    smoothing to allow for the Impulse Response Function (IRF) of the cones. Following
    established optical radiation protection practice, a reasonable margin for uncertainty
    is included in the final metric. The quantitative impact on applications is illustrated
    and discussed.
