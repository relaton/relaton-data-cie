abstract:
- content: In subsidiary roads, lighting is installed to meet the needs of pedestrians
    after dark for safety and their feeling of safety. One aspect is the need to evaluate
    other people to inform the approach-or-avoid decision. To investigate how changes
    in lighting matter for this task, we first need to know where people tend to look.
    Much past work assumes the face is the critical target but this assumption has
    yet to be tested. A pilot study suggested ability to see the hands and face were
    significant cues, but did not enable their separate contributions to be identified.
    This paper describes a second experiment conducted to compare the effect of changes
    in face and hand concealment on evaluations of safety. The results suggest significant
    differences between levels of face concealment but smaller differences for changes
    in hand concealment. The findings from both experiments support the importance
    of the face for evaluating other pedestrians.
