abstract:
- content: CIE 018:2019 presents the basic conventions and principles of physical
    photometry, with the definitions of the photometric units as reformulated in the
    International System of Units (SI) 2019 and the photometric quantities and spectral
    luminous efficiency functions for photopic, mesopic and scotopic vision, including
    10° photopic vision. The relationships between the photometric quantities and
    the radiometric quantities based on the constant Kcd are described, as well as
    the relationships between photochemical and photobiological quantities and photometric
    quantities. The conventions of colorimetry are presented, with the definitions
    of the colour-matching functions for the 2° and 10° field of view, tristimulus
    values, and chromaticity coordinates.
