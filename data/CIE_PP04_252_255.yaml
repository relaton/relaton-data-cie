    range (1500:1 for D65), great spatial uniformity (>97 %) and accurate colour quality.
    It can be used to perform variety of tasks such as colour and vision research,
    colour image quality evaluation for digital cinema and HDR TV studios, calibration
    of digital camera devices, cross-media colour reproduction and colour management.
