abstract:
- content: 'This study introduces the best contents determined for a smart garnish
    light/display based on subjective experiments using an automobile simulator. The
    high-resolution displays can replace conventional garnishes in automobile and
    so play a role as ambient lights or  visual assistances linked with diverse sensors
    to enhance driver security. The appropriate colours and temporal effects are selected
    for three ambient lights and one alertness scene that have been previously determined
    to be user-expected important perceptual factors for the smart garnish: (1) the
    newest (up-to-date) attractiveness factor, (2) high-class interior quality factor,
    (3) comfortable and pleasant factor, and (4) alertness factor.'
