abstract:
- content: Visual comfort, task performance, and observers satisfaction is affected
    by the dynamic nature of visual perception and cognition. The perceived quality
    of the visual environment can be investigated in terms of visual complexity, visual
    clarity, and visual preference. This paper investigates the relationship between
    visual preference, visual clarity, visual complexity, colourfulness and the effect
    of spatial characteristics of images on the perceived quality of indoor environments.
    A visual experiment is conducted to assess the accuracy of image quality metrics
    in estimating the visual complexity, visual clarity, visual preference, and colourfulness
    of 50 images of indoor environments. Seven image quality assessment measures were
    used to estimate observers subjective evaluations. Results indicate that image
    colourfulness metric M correlates statistically significantly with visual preference
    and perception of colourfulness. Visual complexity correlated with five of the
    metrics. Future research will investigate wide range on images, including human-made
    and outdoor scenes.
