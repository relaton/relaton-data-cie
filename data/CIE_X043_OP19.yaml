abstract:
- content: Reproduction of the appearance of real-world materials in virtual environments
    has been one of the ultimate challenges of computer graphics. The required material
    representations depend on the complexity of the material's appearance. They start
    with a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) describing distribution
    of energy reflected in the viewing direction when illuminated from a specific
    direction. As the BRDF cannot capture a material's spatial structure, it has been
    extended to a more general bidirectional texture function (BTF) capturing non-local
    effects in rough material structures, such as occlusions, masking, sub-surface
    scattering, or inter-reflections. A monospectral BTF is a six-dimensional function
    representing the material appearance at each surface point for variable illumination
    and view directions, parameterized by elevation and azimuthal angles. This paper
    describes application of gonioreflectometers for capturing BTF for material visualization
    purposes. It starts with the reference measurement setup and continue with introduction
    of portable measurement approaches to capturing approximate BTF. Finally, we discuss
    future challenges in material acquisition.
