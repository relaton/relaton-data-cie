abstract:
- content: The dimensioning of lighting installations is performed according to the
    specifications of CIE documents and relevant standards. Differences are often
    observed between simulations and experimental measurements regarding the quality
    criteria and luminance distributions. This paper deals with road lighting quality
    parameters evaluation between experimental ILMD images and calculations. Influence
    of image rectification is first examined. Impacts of image resolution, grid resolution
    and grid positioning on average luminance, overall uniformity and longitudinal
    uniformity are evaluated. An elliptical method based on human eye resolution and
    perspective projection is presented for road lighting calculations. It conducts
    to a good robustness regarding misalignment and give access to a pixel-to-pixel
    comparison with experimental ILMD images.
