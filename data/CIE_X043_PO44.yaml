abstract:
- content: Surface scattering properties are fully described and defined by the bidirectional
    scatter distribution function (BSDF), which encompasses both the bidirectional
    reflectance distribution function (BRDF) as well as the bidirectional transmittance
    distribution function (BTDF). Due to the lack of any standardization with regard
    to the optical design of BSDF measurement devices, several instruments have been
    introduced, each with different optical features. As such, experimentally determined
    BSDF data of the same sample acquired with different instruments can exhibit large
    variations. In this paper a method to transform measured BSDF data is proposed
    in order to enable a comparison between the BSDF data as obtained with different
    measurement devices.
