abstract:
- content: The standards and Calibration Laboratory has recently developed the calibration
    service for the enclosed-type irradiance light source in the spectral range from
    300 nm to 850 nm. The calibration is based on the source-based method measured
    by a fiber-coupled system. In this paper, the calibration setup, measurement model
    and the associated uncertainty are presented. The expanded measurement uncertainty
    is estimated to be less than 3,3 % over the measured spectral range which can
    support the needs from the testing and certification industry.
