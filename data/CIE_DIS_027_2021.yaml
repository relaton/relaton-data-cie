abstract:
- content: This standard specifies the requirements for measurement of electrical,
    photometric, colorimetric and retroreflective properties of road illumination
    devices, light-signalling devices and retroreflective devices for road vehicles
    including their light sources as given by various UN regulations. These properties
    are usually acquired with a DC supply voltage, possibly supplied by an associated
    light source control gear.
