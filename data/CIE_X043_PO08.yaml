abstract:
- content: This paper explores the impact of chromatic adaptation, colour space and
    test-colour samples on fidelity values and obtained colour differences. The CAT02
    transform and CIELUV colour space do not result in remarkably different Ra values
    compared to current CIE13.3 computation process. Colour differences computed with
    CIELAB, CIEDE2000 and CAM02-UCS are highly correlated, but different from those
    computed with CIELUV. Uniform distribution of test-colour samples, under the reference
    illuminant, depends on the CCT of the light source. It has been demonstrated that
    highly saturated samples result in larger average colour differences, but smaller
    changes in relative gamut area index values. Combining samples with different
    saturation levels into one average fidelity or relative gamut area index value
    masks valuable information on actual hue-specific colour changes. The number of
    samples should be between 18 and 30 to cover the whole hue-angle circle without
    significant information loss compared to using 90 test-colour samples.
