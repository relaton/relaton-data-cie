abstract:
- content: The living environment at the evacuation center is very important for ensuring
    the health, safety and security of the evacuees, but at present, preparations
    for providing a satisfactory living environment are not enough. In order to improve
    that, we have to consider various conditions, such as "ensure the lighting environment
    for the safe and secure and sleep," "toilet ensure," "ensure the thermal environment".
    In this study, we investigated the actual condition of glare in the nighttime
    lighting environment of evacuation center and examined the improvement method.
    Regarding the glare improvement method, the effectiveness of indirect lighting
    was shown based on the results of brightness distribution simulation with Radiance.
