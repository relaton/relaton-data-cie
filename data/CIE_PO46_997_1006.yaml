    an independent examination of the domestic lighting market. This activity is carried
    out and is curr ently running in the competition on the Eurasian Illuminating
    Engineering Award. To do this, the selection was made of certified test centers
    and laboratories in the Russia and the CIS countries who are involved in the measurements
    of light, colour and electrical characteristics of lighting devices by participating
    in the competition. The central place in the group of laboratories is devoted
    to VNISI Test Centre with advanced measuring systems, laboratory conditions corresponding
    to the international standards, with heat and cold chambers, and highly qualified
    personnel. Analysis work center allows highlight a number of important problems
    of metrological support of modern measuring systems used in photometry and colorimetry.
