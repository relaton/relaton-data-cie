abstract:
- content: For several months now, the global pandemic that we are experiencing has
    highlighted that the quality of the habitat has a proven impact on our quality
    of life. In this context, it becomes fundamental to take into account the needs
    of each individual. The aim of this study is to show the benefits of designing
    the right atmosphere for the place and the needs of all inhabitants. Designing
    the ambience of a space leads us to anticipate the environment that will influence
    the subject who lives there. The design of the colour and light atmosphere contributes
    to improving the quality of life by ensuring a certain comfort in their daily
    activities. Through a case study, we will present an analysis protocol to examine
    a visual environment. The data collected will allow designers to move towards
    a more sensitive and adapted design of lighting and colour applied to collective
    housing.
