abstract:
- content: A method is proposed for analysing spectral components from the observed
    images of fluorescent objects and reconstructing realistic appearances of the
    fluorescent objects under different illuminations. First, the Donaldson matrices
    of fluorescent objects are estimated at each pixel point using a spectral imaging
    system under two-illuminant projections. Observed images of the fluorescent objects
    under arbitrary illuminations are constructed using the estimated matrices and
    the target illuminant. Next, the mutual illumination phenomenon between fluorescent
    objects is analysed. The Donaldson matrix of each object and the spectral image
    components are estimated from the images with the mutual illumination. The estimated
    component images are used for reconstructing the same objects under different
    light source. Finally the feasibility of the method is shown in appearance reconstruction
    of fluorescent objects with/without mutual illumination effects under different
    light sources.
