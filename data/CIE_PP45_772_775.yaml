abstract:
- content: In various indoor and outdoor lighting applications, a wide range of illuminance
    levels and correlated colour temperatures can be found. This results in very different
    levels of perceived visual clarity and spatial brightness impressions. These visual
    attributes are important to assure the acceptance and comfort of the lighting
    installation and for good visual performance. In the present paper, new descriptor
    quantities are defined for visual clarity (C) and brightness (B) combining numeric
    descriptors of the rod, cone and ipRGC signals computed from the spectrum. The
    quantities C and B were derived by re-analysing the results of two previous psychophysical
    experiments, one on photopic visual clarity and one on mesopic brightness.
