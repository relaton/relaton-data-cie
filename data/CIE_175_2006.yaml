abstract:
- content: "Visual appearance can be one of the most critical parameters affecting
    customer choice and it needs, therefore, to be quantifiable to ensure uniformity
    and reproducibility. A starting point in assessing the appearance of a consumer
    product might be the measurement of its colour. A description of its total appearance,
    however, cannot be achieved by the definition of colour alone; other attributes
    of the material from which it is fabricated contribute to the overall appearance.
    \n\nStarting from a definition of soft metrology and a description of measurement
    scales, this report describes a framework on which a set of measurements could
    be made to provide correlates of visual appearance. It will be shown that the
    interactions between the various components of the framework are complex, that
    physical parameters relating to objects are influenced, at the perception stage,
    by the physiological response of the human visual system and, in addition by the
    psychological aspects of human learning, pattern, culture and tradition.\n\nThe
    result might be to conclude that an attempt to measure appearance may be too bold
    a step to take. Thus, a sub-framework is considered in terms of what can now be
    measured, and what might be measured after further investigation and research.
    By dealing with the optical properties of materials it is seen that there are,
    perhaps, four headings under which possible measures might be made: colour, gloss,
    translucency and texture. It is recognised that these measures are not necessarily
    independent; colour may influence gloss, colour will certainly influence translucency,
    and texture is probably a function of all three of the other measures. \n\nColour
    measurement, colorimetry, is based on the measurement of spectral reflectance,
    and is an established science that is possible using commercial instrumentation
    available at reasonable cost. Two shortcomings are identified. First, there are
    a number of modern materials where colour measurements made using a single pair
    of illumination/viewing angles is not sufficient to describe the perceived colorimetric
    effect. Thus, measurement at more illumination/viewing angle combinations is required.
    Second, the traditional, CIE recommended colorimetric parameters, while providing
    correlates of visual percepts, are not able to predict the absolute appearance
    of a coloured sample: colour appearance models are now able to do this. \n\nThe
    measurement of gloss is an established methodology but there is some doubt as
    to the scientific basis for making the measurements using the present method and
    attempts are being made to define alternative approaches. The extension of gloss
    measurement, which is essentially a measurement made at a\nspecific angle depending
    on the apparent gloss of the sample, to investigate the shape of the gloss peak,
    should provide more information. \n\nTranslucency is a subjective term that relates
    to a scale of values going from total opacity to total transparency. This whole
    subject area needs investigation to find a rigorous measurement solution that
    will probably be industry specific. \n\nTexture is a harder variable to measure.
    The advent of digital imaging systems makes the acquisition of images of materials
    relatively easy, assuming due consideration is given to the resolution of the
    image capturing device, be it a camera or a scanner. \nCharacterising these images
    to give accurate CIE based colorimetry is now possible and the application of
    suitable analysis software should be able to provide measurement scales that relate
    to the perceived texture. The idea of establishing a series of 'standard' textures
    has been suggested. \n\nThe report is written in English, with a short summary
    in French and German."
