abstract:
- content: By 2030, all public lighting in Flanders, Belgium will be replaced by LED
    technology. However, artificial lighting properties, such as flickering due to
    light modulation, influence nocturnal insects. This research describes the development
    of a novel measurement device that can control the flickering frequency, luminous
    flux and correlated color temperature (CCT) of an LED light box. This to evaluate
    the impact of artificial light modulation on insects. A case study has been developed
    using four identical setups that were placed on the university campus. For each
    setup, the flickering frequency can be varied (f = 0 Hz, 80 Hz, 120 Hz, 150 Hz)
    while other parameters are unchanged. When an insect is detected, an image is
    taken which allows further determination. In this paper, descriptive statistics
    on the number of detected insects are presented. The results of the prototype
    and measurement setup are promising for further research in different areas of
    biology.
