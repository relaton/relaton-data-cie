abstract:
- content: In this work, we present a method to describe the model of a goniophotometer
    for uncertainty analysis by state-of-the-art Universal Robotic Description Format
    (URDF). The parameters of the kinematic chain model are determined by measurements
    of the geometric properties of the goniophotometer. The uncertainties of the pose
    are determined using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of the kinematic chain. The
    measured geometric uncertainties are input the MC simulations. The proposed framework
    enables high level description of kinematic chains for MC simulations of measurement
    systems. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the total system is demonstrated over
    the MC trials to prove a sufficient amount of MC trials. The results of this generic
    approach are evaluated against an existing model and the uncertainty determination
    of the same goniophotometer.
