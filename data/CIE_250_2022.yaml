abstract:
- content: This Technical Report provides basic measurement principles and practical
    guidance on spectroradiometry of optical radiation sources in the ultraviolet,
    visible and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum in the wavelength
    range from 200 nm to 2 500 nm.The document primarily deals with spectral measurements
    of irradiance, radiance, radiant intensity, radiant flux and derivative quantities.
    The document provides a detailed overview of relevant terminology and basic measurement
    principles, including those for instrument calibration. It provides practical
    guidance for identifying, understanding and quantifying relevant measurement uncertainty
    components.
