abstract:
- content: The reflectance properties of coatings with effect pigments result in a
    quite strange colour sensation for humans. The colour of effect pigments is caused
    by anisotropic optical processes like low-order scattering, interference, or diffraction.
    This work specifically deals with the reflectance characterization of effect coatings
    with diffraction pigments. Its main purpose is to determine the most adequate
    illumination/observation geometries to characterize the variation of its colour
    gamut. We propose a relevant geometrical variable to study the spectral reflectance
    and colour variation of coatings with diffraction pigments. At fixed values of
    this geometrical variable, the component of the spectral BRDF due to diffraction
    is almost constant. Based on the spectral BRDF of six coatings, which were measured
    by the robot-based goniospectrophotometer available at IO-CSIC, we show how the
    spectral BRDF can be represented by basic functions, which depend on either the
    wavelength or on the proposed geometrical variable. Finally, the chromatic analysis
    of the studied coatings was discussed.
