abstract:
- content: Cultural factors in Libya (and other Muslim countries) require female privacy
    to be maintained. Outside the home, females must wear clothing that reveals only
    the face and hands. When inside the home and located near windows, a similar degree
    of clothing cover, or, window screening, is required. This reduces exposure to
    natural daylight, with resultant reduction in health benefits of daylight. We
    are therefore investigating the degree to which window privacy devices offer sufficient
    privacy to permit relaxed clothing in the home, and whether this leads to an increased
    daylight exposure. Two window coverings were tested, horizontal blinds and frosted
    glass, varying the free area and degree of frosting respectively. The degree of
    privacy offered was operationalised by identification of the clothing level worn
    by a target behind the window screen, the aim being to reduce this to a chance
    level. For horizontal blinds, the free area must be reduced to 3% to maintain
    sufficient privacy, which is unlikely to permit sufficient daylight to offset
    the wearing of relaxed clothing. While a high degree of frosting is required for
    a similar level of privacy, this may permit more daylight.
