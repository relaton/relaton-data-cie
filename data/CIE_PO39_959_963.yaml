abstract:
- content: In this work, dimming properties of a number of commercially available
    luminaires were measured in an Ulbricht-sphere using an automated computer algorithm
    and control. Results showed a high variance of dimming curves depending on different
    luminaire properties. When introduced to standard energy calculation frameworks,
    these dimming characteristics significantly lowered the energy requirements of
    the installation as compared to the standard calculation procedure. However, current
    standard methods for energy efficiency evaluation do not by default provide the
    possibility of using a measured dimming curve in the calculations. Thus, the energy
    savings remain undetected in the lighting design and decision process. A better
    documentation and integration into energy calculation procedures could add an
    important quality aspect to lighting decision schemes.
