abstract:
- content: Infrared eye trackers are employed to achieve communication through gaze
    interaction, which is an important application of modern electro-optics and computer
    technology to the benefit of persons with disabilities who have major motor impairments,
    as well as for general use as a human-to-computer interaction device.By tracking
    eye movements of persons with severe motor disabilities, the individuals can interact
    with automated equipment through movements of their gaze. In addition to purely
    passive systems, which may only employ ambient lighting, more typical eye trackers
    employ active infrared eye-tracking techniques. However, questions have arisen
    with regard to the potential optical radiation hazards of using infrared eye trackers
    for the much-extended durations of 10 to 12 hours each day for a lifetime. Conventional
    eye trackers employed in the research setting would rarely be used for more than
    an hour. Several exposure guidelines exist today, but the question has arisen
    whether the chronic nature of exposure for such an infrared illuminator for assistive
    devices falls outside the assumed conditions of daily exposure.This technical
    report explores the basis of the current human exposure guidelines, their scientific
    basis and underlying assumptions in order to determine the direct applicability
    of these guidelines to this application. It is found that the most limiting exposure
    criterion is the infrared exposure limit to protect against delayed changes in
    the crystalline lens of the eye. The Technical Committee also examined some representative
    eye trackers and found that the day-long average exposure in these typical examples
    of current technology did not exceed that criterion.The publication is written
    in English, with a short summary in French and German.
