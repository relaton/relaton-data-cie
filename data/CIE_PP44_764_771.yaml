abstract:
- content: Recently, LED based lighting systems are applied for general lighting and
    automotive lighting as well. To control the luminance of the LED lighting sources,
    time modulated control, called PWM (pulse width modulation), is frequently applied
    as a dimming control method. This paper presents that the eye movement speed of
    each individual influences the visibility threshold frequency of the phantom array
    effect. RGB full colour flat panel light sources are used in the experiment. The
    experiment result shows that the person with higher eye movement speed tends to
    have higher threshold frequency.
