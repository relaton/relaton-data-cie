abstract:
- content: The final goal of this research is to develop a facade system with a sun-shading
    device that is autonomously controlled as an integrated solution for daylight
    and electric lighting. The facade system has photovoltaic sensors (PV-slats) on
    the outer surface of the sun-shading device and can monitor daylight illuminance
    by using output of the photovoltaic sensors. This research work aims to propose
    an appropriate sun-shading control strategy for the facade system with PV-slats.
    It proposes a method to obtain monthly thresholds of vertical global illuminance
    on windows, as functions of solar altitude or solar profile angle, to judge whether
    the windows receive direct sunlight or not. It also proposes a sun-shading angle
    named PV-slat angle. The proposed system includes electric lighting that supplements
    insufficient illuminance in rooms. Compared with the basic sun-shading control
    angle, PV-slat angle showed better results in both air-conditioning load and lighting
    simulations.
