    This Symposium was organised by CIE Division 2 in cooperation with the Swiss
    Lighting Society (SLG), and was hosted by the Federal Office of Metrology (METAS),
    Bern, Switzerland. The two-day Symposium included a one day tutorial presenting
    the state-of-the-art techniques in the field of photometry. On the second day, a
    Scientific Symposium featured 35 contributed papers presenting recent research in
    photometry, colorimetry, and radiometry with a focus on the methods using spectral
    and imaging techniques. The Symposium had four sessions, Session I:
    Goniophotometry and Spatial Methods, Session II: Imaging and Spectral Methods,
    Session III: Metrology for LEDs, and Session IV: Advances in Radiometry.
