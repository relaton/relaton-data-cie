abstract:
- content: Reflection properties of the pavement have to be considered when designing
    road lighting installations. These properties depend on the material and the texture
    and can be specified by means of a set of luminance coefficients also called the
    Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). We present in this paper
    our in-house built gonioreflectometer for in-lab measurements, especially suited
    for public lighting applications. The instrument specificities and methodology
    to compute the BRDF are described and some examples of BRDF measurements are showed.
    Further developments and use of our gonioreflectometer are also listed (wet surfaces,
    spectral measurements).
