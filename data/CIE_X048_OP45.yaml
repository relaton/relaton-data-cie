abstract:
- content: New colour appearance scales close to daily experience and image quality
    enhancement are highly desired including whiteness, blackness, vividness and depth.
    This article describes a new experiment to accumulate the data under HDR (high
    dynamic range) conditions. The data were then used to test the performance of
    different colour appearance scales such as CIELAB and CAM16-UCS plus the recent
    extension by Berns Vab*, Dab*. The results showed those Berns scales gave reasonable
    performance. However, there was no scale capable of predicting colour appearance
    data covering a wide dynamic range. New scales were developed based on the absolute
    scales of brightness and colourfulness of CAM16-UCS and gave accurate prediction
    to the data.
