abstract:
  content: Systematic studies on the visibility of a traffic sign on an experimental
    road in a foggy environment were performed. We defined contrast ratios Cpb and
    Cps as the level of fog and index of visibility of the traffic sign, respectively.
    The analysis of the experimental results show that Cps of passive state of the
    traffic sign is proportional to Cpb for all varieties of luminaire and headlights.
    While Cps of active state is linear with Cpb and the intercept and slope are fairly
    dependent on position and type of luminaire.
