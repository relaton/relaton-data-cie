abstract:
- content: We applied the same effect coating with metallic pigments to three surfaces
    with different convex curvatures (flat, slightly curved and very curved), and
    their spectral BRDF was measured at different pairs of illumination and observation
    directions. We found that, at specular directions, the higher the curvature of
    the sample the lower the spectrally-averaged BRDF, whereas, at aspecular angles
    close to the specular directions, the higher the curvature the higher the spectrally-averaged
    BRDF, which is very likely due to the convolution by curvature. But, in addition,
    we have found another impact of the curvature, which is not spectrally neutral
    and cannot be explained by simple convolution. It is observed at some in-plane
    geometries with high incidence angles. The colour of the curved sample is slightly
    more chromatic at these geometries, which points out that the effect pigments
    contribute in higher extent to the spectral BRDF.
