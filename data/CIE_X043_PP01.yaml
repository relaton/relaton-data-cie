abstract:
- content: The design and manufacture of a detection system suitable for an 'underfilled
    sample' goniospectrophotometer system illuminated by a quasi-monochromatic beam
    is described and assessed. Optomechanical design of the detection system was optimised
    to ensure equal efficiency for both vertically and horizontally polarized light.
    To achieve this, a mirror tilted about both vertical and horizontal axes is used
    to focus light into a custom made sintered halon integrating sphere. Photon detection
    is performed by a combination of a state-of-the-art small factor photon counter
    and a Si based detector in conjunction with custom made switch integrator low
    noise electronics. This hybrid detector covers ten orders of magnitude of linear
    operation.
