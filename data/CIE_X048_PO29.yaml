abstract:
- content: Obtaining experimental data on the electrical and photometric parameters
    of low-pressure tubular amalgam lamps with a discharge in a mixture of mercury
    vapor and inert gases at high current densities of 0.5-1.2 A/cm2 with frequencies
    of tens of kilohertz is one of the key problems of modern metrology. Since a full-fledged
    study of the properties of experimental samples of mercury lamps is impossible
    without a reliable method of photometric measurements, and for ozone lamps such
    a technique, taking into account the features of the object of study, has not
    yet been proposed, its development and testing is the main task of this work.
    Based on the analysis of existing techniques, a technique for measuring the fluxes
    of the 185 and 254 nm lines of a low-pressure mercury lamp is proposed, taking
    into account the change in the nature of the spatial distribution of radiation
    during operation, without directly measuring the RIC. The method proposed by the
    author for measuring the fluxes of ozonizing and bactericidal radiation can be
    used as the basis for the development of an automated system for measuring parameters
    and monitoring the quality of gas-discharge UV radiation sources.
