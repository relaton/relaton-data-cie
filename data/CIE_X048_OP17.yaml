abstract:
- content: The paper describes the studies started by an inter-disciplinary team in
    finding a disinfection method using a coating with photocatalytically activated
    antimicrobial properties by visible spectrum radiation. An own method of preparation
    led to the obtaining of a photocatalytic pigment based on copper-doped titanium
    dioxide to move the activation spectrum to the visible range. The preparation
    method was designed so as to allow transposition into industrial production. The
    demonstration and measurement of the photocatalytic effect for certification as
    an industrial product was done based on an adapted method, starting from two existing
    standards. A washable paint containing the photocatalytic pigment was tested "in
    situ", the results demonstrating the reduction of microbial load. The paper is
    based on current knowledge about light-activated antimicrobiological agents (LAAs)
    in an attempt to further the study of visible spectrum radiation, which in combination
    with a series of photosensitizers excited by this radiation, have the role of
    generating photocatalytic reactions with disinfection effect.
