abstract:
- content: Research on the non-visual responses to light under real-world conditions
    has been hindered by the lack of suitable measuring devices. Here, we present
    a novel, portable and miniaturised light-dosimeter attached to a spectacle frame,
    taking measurements in the near-corneal plane. The recorded data is processed
    with the help of the custom-made software package Lido Studio. In addition to
    commonly used metrics such as illuminance and correlated colour temperature (CCT),
    it also provides metrics standardised in CIE S 026:2018. Data can be analysed
    directly in Lido Studio or exported as a PDF report or a comma-separated values
    (CSV) file for further in-depth time-series analyses. The Federal Institute of
    Metrology (METAS) optics laboratory (Bern-Wabern, Switzerland) assessed the light-dosimeters
    spectral and geometric properties. Subsequentially, the team at the Centre for
    Chronobiology (Basel, Switzerland) confirmed that measurements performed with
    a light-dosimeter were comparable to those from a commercial spectroradiometer.
