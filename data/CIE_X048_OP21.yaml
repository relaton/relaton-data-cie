abstract:
- content: Current trends in discomfort glare research have suggested the influence
    of physiological parameters on individual glare perception. To this end, we hypothesize
    that a specific ocular physiology characteristic, namely the macular pigment (MP)
    in the retina, could have an influence on glare sensitivity, encouraged by recent
    findings from the literature that have shown that high MP levels were indicative
    of better visual performance. This study investigates whether a persons sensitivity
    to glare could be somehow correlated to their macular pigment optical density
    (MPOD). We measured MPOD in 56 participants and compared it with their discomfort
    glare thresholds, which were determined psychophysically by exposing the participants
    to a series of lighting conditions varying in intensity. We found that the influence
    of MPOD on glare sensitivity is borderline significant with small effect size
    but does not follow intuition. Additional data will be required to validate and
    refine these initial findings.
