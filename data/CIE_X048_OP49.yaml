abstract:
- content: Visibility is one of the fundamental factors for explaining the lighting
    environment, and various quantitative indexes for these have been made in such
    a manner that directly finds the formulae that best match the numerous subjective
    evaluations. Recently neurophysiology-based models have been paid attention as
    the complementary or alternative methods to these conventional indexes. In this
    paper we will introduce the normalization and gain control models, which are generally
    accepted theories in the visual information processing, to estimate the visibility,
    and verify the validity of this algorithm by comparing with the subjective evaluation
    in the experimental room. The result showed that the algorithm in this research
    could estimate the visibility of the simple objects in the experimental space
    with a pseudo window with great accuracy, however, it is desirable and necessary
    to publicly discuss various algorithms and clarify their reliability based on
    the verification results under various situations.
