abstract:
- content: The impact of systematically varied realistic illumination patterns and
    intensities on the apparent brightness and contrast of an empty, context-free
    room is investigated. Along with the apparent brightness, contrast and perceived
    edge transition sharpness of the resulting lighting distributions visible on the
    room?s rear wall. Several virtual scenes of an empty room with varying lighting
    settings were rendered, employing a physical-based rendering engine. In total
    20 virtual scenes were estimated by each observer (six male and five female) on
    several visual aspects (brightness, contrast and edge transition sharpness). Observers
    could estimate room brightness consistently and primarily correlated with average
    scene luminance (RÂ² = 0.85). Results also show that estimating contrast without
    any predefined criterium and definition is difficult and resulted in observers
    adopting different criteria for an indoor lit room.
