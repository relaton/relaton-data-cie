abstract:
- content: There have been many recent studies on the predictive equation of spatial
    brightness. Nevertheless, only a few have considered the colour effect, a vital
    element of space. Previous studies have pointed out that colours have an influence
    on the perception of brightness; for example, it is known that as purity of the
    colour stimulus increases, and as the colour moves closer to blue, perception
    of brightness becomes stronger. Considering these results and their influence
    on spatial impression, colour effect should be considered when examining perception
    of brightness. This research aims to adjust the predictive equation of luminance
    and spatial brightness considering the effect of colour. Previous experimental
    conditions were replicated then re-measured using a CCD camera and software to
    extract X, Y and Z distributions to analyse and derive an optimal coefficient
    of X, Y and Z.
