abstract:
- content: The general V(A) mismatch index, f_1^' quantifies the mismatch between
    the spectral responsivity of a photometer, s(A), and the spectral luminous efficiency
    function, V(A). A short review of its historical development is given to explain
    the reasons for the current definition and which adjustments may be useful for
    the future. The properties of the current definition are described in detail. It
    is very likely that in the future, calibration of photometers will be done with
    a white LED light source as reference. It might involve the need for a more adequate
    definition of the general V(A) mismatch index, either by using a different normalization
    in f_1^'   for the spectral responsivity of the photometer or by introducing a
    different type of function for assessing the mismatch. On the other hand, the
    measurement of coloured LEDs is also becoming increasingly important. Is a single
    quality index for white and coloured light sources sufficient?
