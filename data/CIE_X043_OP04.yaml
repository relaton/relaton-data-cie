abstract:
- content: The total visual appearance of a surface is of concern in a wide panel
    of industrial sectors. In many manufacturing processes, more than instruments,
    the visual system has the last word when the quality of the finished product is
    at stake. Psychophysical studies aim to produce scales describing our perception
    of stimuli. In the field of gloss appraisal, psychophysics has been of importance
    since Hunter's early work, and a variety of scales describing one or more visual
    aspects of surface gloss have been derived. However, to our knowledge, no metrological
    assessment of scales constructed from one and the same set of samples through
    different protocols has ever been carried out. In this study, psychometric functions
    of a commercially available gloss scale are derived from experiments conducted
    under different assessment conditions, by two sets of naive observers, and using
    two distinct protocols. The metrological validity of the results is discussed.
    The potential output of this work may lead the way towards the definition of a
    standard gloss observer.
