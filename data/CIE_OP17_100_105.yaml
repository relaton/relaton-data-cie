abstract:
- content: The pedestrians' support system were introduced. This system uses a Visible
    Light Communication (VLC) with Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) to help people particularly
    with low vision using lights from the illuminated bollards and road studs etc,
    on the streets. In this system, the lights can not only be for illuminating the
    environments, but also sending safety information in the neighbourhood to people
    through receivers. The information can be played as audio information. In this
    paper, visual evaluations were carried out to select appropriate lighting patterns
    by normal vision people. The appropriate lights were selected also by considering
    the opinions of low vision people (Iki et al., 2015; Oshiba et al., 2016). Interview
    with low vision people and their behaviour observation were also carried out.
    Reflecting the results, more ideas of the use of the system and also system of
    receivers were proposed.
