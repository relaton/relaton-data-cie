abstract:
- content: People have extended working hours with rapid change of social change today.
    Some studies find the long working hours and high use of eyes would have physical
    and mental conditions be in long-term fatigue and further increase the risks of
    emotion, sleep problems, and low work efficiency. How to improve the office workers'
    state is the most important issue. Therefore, we propose 12 lighting environment
    with different colour temperatures, illuminations and peak wavelengths of blue
    lights and analyse the physiological and psychological impacts for visual fatigue.
    In addition, Grey relational analysis is applied to analyse the correlations between
    physiological and psychological evaluations to control and stabilize the quality
    of experiment.
