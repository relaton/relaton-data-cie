abstract:
- content: With age, the variation in visual and driving performance increases . Decreases
    in visual performance eventually cause many seniors to change their driving behaviour
    or even to refrain from driving at night at all. To establish the degradation
    of which visual functions contributes most, we conducted a literature review and
    a survey among ageing drivers. From both, an increased sensitivity to glare and
    a reduced contrast sensitivity and a bility to adapt to darkness, are flagged.
    All three are aggravated by rain. Factors not recognized by survey participants
    in all countries are UFOV and the perception of movement . In literature, decreasing
    reaction time and difficulties estimating time to contact are also identified
    as major contributors to driving restricting by ageing drivers.
