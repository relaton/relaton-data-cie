abstract:
- content: Past studies have hinted that average colour rendering measures, with a
    particular focus on average gamut area measures, cannot predict the colour discrimination
    ability of highly structured spectra. A recent study by Esposito and Houser solidified
    this fi nding, and showed that a new measure, Rd—an error score based on the light-source
    induced hue transpositions of the FM-100 hue test—could reliably predict error
    scores. The current study optimized spectra using Rd (and accompanying sub-indices)
    to determine if several individual transpositions, each with a different nominal
    hue, would result in different c olour discrimination ability. The results show
    that four separate stimuli, each of which transposes one cap at different hue
    angl es, do not produce statistically different mean error scores. Assuming the
    FM -100 hue test is indicative of colour discrimination ability and knowing that
    cap transpositions are a strong predictor of FM - 100 error scores, the results
    suggest that colour discrimination ability may not differ based on hue.
