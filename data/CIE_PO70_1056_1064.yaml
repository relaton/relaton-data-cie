    In the display of arts, there are two competing criteria: appearance and damage. The use of LEDs in museums is becoming more frequent for the lower UV and IR. However, the impact of LEDs on collections preservation is not yet completely investigated especially for the contemporary photographic materials. The goal of this study was to identify that the CIE157:2004 method, two experiments were conducted to find effective radiant exposures (Exp-1) and predict effective radiant exposures (1 unit of ?E*ab) using BWS colour fading
    model accelerated exposure tests (Exp-2), the photographic materials fading produced by white LEDs and a traditional halogen lamp. According to the result of Exp -1, the LEDs are safer than conventional illuminance for the illumination of photographic materials if used at an appropriate light level for museum applications. Furthermore, Exp-2 model provide the convenient method for museum to predict the colour difference of contemporary photographic materials either in short-term or long-term exhibition if they use Blue Wool standards as general dosimeters.
