abstract:
- content: In this study, 20 observers evaluated the whiteness appearance of 88 samples
    under four light settings at different CCT levels (i.e., 3000, 4000, 5000, and
    6500 K). The 88 samples were carefully selected and the spectral power distributions
    of the light settings were carefully designed using a spectrally tunable LED device,
    so that the chromaticities of the samples under each light settings uniformly
    covered a wide range along the yellow/blue direction in a colour space, which
    had never been realized before. The results, together with the two recent studies,
    allowed the derivation of ellipsoids for classifying the whiteness appearance
    for surface colours. A comprehensive whiteness formula that can accurately characterize
    the whiteness appearance for surface colours under an arbitrary light source by
    considering different conditions is still necessary and the work is undergoing.
