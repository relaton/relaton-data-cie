abstract:
- content: This paper reports the result of a survey on entertainment lighting distributed
    to 246 museums and 56 theatres in Sweden. The questions concerned the lighting
    technology used, experience from changing lighting systems, plans, problems, apprehensions
    and expectations. The replies showed that the transition to LED has been much
    faster in museums than in theaters and 35% of the theatres do not plan for a transition
    to LED. Reasons given are economy, light quality, and dimming functionality. Lighting
    professionals are generally sceptical in exchanging halogen lights. The artistic
    expression in lighting design goes beyond the specifications and what is promised
    in the data sheet. To facilitate a smoother transition to modern lighting technologies,
    the quality of the white light and proper function of the luminaires must be ensured
    and the communication between the manufacturers, retailers, lighting professionals
    and other artistic functions must be improved.
