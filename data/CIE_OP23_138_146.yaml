abstract:
- content: One of the temporal light artefacts, which can occur in temporally modulated
    light systems, is the phantom array effect, also known as ghosting. This paper
    studies the influence of frequency, waveform and colour of light output of a LED
    source on the visibility of the phantom array effect. Results indicate that the
    visibility of this effect depends on frequency, following a U-shape form, with
    the effect being most visible at around 600 Hz. Next to that, the phantom array
    effect is more readily perceived when the light waveform is square, compared to
    sinusoidal wave. The results also show how the visibility of the phantom array
    effect depends on the colour of light output; blue light results in less visible
    effect, compared to red and white light.
