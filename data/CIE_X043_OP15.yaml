abstract:
- content: A visual search experiment was carried out using reaction time technique
    to investigate the influence of colour on visual conspicuity.  A total of 30 colour-normal
    Taiwanese observers took part in the study.  The experiment consisted of 264 trials,
    in which each observer was asked to locate a target among 24 coloured circles
    shown on a computer display as fast as possible.  The experimental results indicate
    that the reaction time for locating the target was influenced mainly by mean CIELAB
    chroma difference between the target and the 23 distractors; the larger chroma
    difference, the shorter reaction time.  The reciprocal of reaction time, a measure
    of visual conspicuity in this study, had a correlation coefficient of 0.84 when
    compared with mean chroma difference.  The findings may help develop guidelines
    in visual communication design to enhance visual conspicuity for data visualisation
    in a complex layout.
