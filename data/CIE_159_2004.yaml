    A colour appearance model provides a viewing condition specific method for transforming tristimulus values to and/or from perceptual attribute correlates. This document outlines a specific colour appearance model, CIECAM02, which may be useful for colour management applications. This model is based on CIECAM97s colour appearance model and consists of a chromatic adaptation transform and equations for computing a set of perceptual attribute correlates. The evolution and application of this colour appearance model are presented.

    This report replaces CIE 131-1998, The CIE 1997 interim colour appearance model (simple version) CIECAM97s.

    The Report is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It consists of 22 pages with 1 figure and 7 tables.
