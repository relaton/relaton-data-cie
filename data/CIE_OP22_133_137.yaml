abstract:
- content: In order to investigate the best red primary for colour display from KANSEI
    evaluation point of view, evaluation experiment using SD method was conducted
    using four different red primaries of 610 nm, 620 nm, 630 nm, or 640 nm. The red
    primaries of 630 nm and 640 nm provides deep colour and impressive feeling, but
    the most unnatural. On the other hand, the red primary of 610 nm results the higher
    score for naturalness assessment, while it gives neither deep colour nor impressive
    feeling. Changing the wavelength of the red primary causes the area of chromaticity
    distribution of test images. Results of the present study indicate that to investigate
    the relations among chromaticity distribution of image, colour appearance of main
    colour(s) of images, and KANSEI evaluation is needed.
