abstract:
- content: Surfaces of materials from cultural heritage are exceptionally varied as
    patina, varnish, wear or scratches are added intentionally or with time to the
    base material, whether it is wood, marble, stucco, or brass. Measuring their texture
    provides a lot of information to curators but it constitutes a challenging task
    for the engineer. The present study focuses on the question of texture acquisition
    by means of two optical micro-topographic instruments. As those instruments deeply
    differ in their working principle, it is necessary to check if results are comparable
    in terms of roughness. Moreover, in order to define the space of materials they
    are able to record, the study highlighted how the global appearance of an object
    interferes with the measurement of its surface relief, because of the design of
    the utilized instruments.
