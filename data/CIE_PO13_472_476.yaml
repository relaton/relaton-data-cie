abstract:
- content: We have quantitatively studied the visibility of a man-made foggy road
    based on the on-site measurements of luminance images. The statistical distribution
    of effective sky luminance and effective extinction coefficient are used to study
    the performance of the foggy road lighted with various types of luminaire. The
    comparison results show that the visibility of the road with LED luminaires is
    somewhat better than those by HPS and MH lightings.
