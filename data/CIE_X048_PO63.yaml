abstract:
- content: Cycling has a range of benefits and should be encouraged, but darkness
    may put people off from cycling due to reductions in visibility, road safety and
    personal security. We summarise analyses of observational data to confirm the
    negative impact darkness has on cycling rates. Using a Case / Control method that
    accounts for confounding factors such as time of day and seasonal variations in
    weather, we demonstrate a consistent effect of darkness across different locations
    and countries. The size of this effect varies though, suggesting certain unknown
    factors may be important in mediating the impact of darkness on cycling rates.
    One factor that is known to mediate the effect is road lighting. We show that
    increased illuminance can offset the reductions in cyclists caused by darkness
    and also that there may be an optimal illuminance after which no further benefits
    may be achieved.Â
