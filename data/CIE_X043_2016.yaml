    more information.\n          \n\n        Visual assessment of the appearance of
    objects and materials involves aspects such as:\n• the object itself and its optical
    characteristics;\n• the position, size, shape and spectrum of the light source;\n•
    the nature of the visual field surrounding the object;\n• the observer’s visual
    system with its amazing complexity.\n\nResearch areas have been formed which are
    devoted to the four visual attributes: colour, gloss, texture and translucency.
    The development of new visual appearance effects, such as goniochromatism and
    graininess, have required progress and evolution in the quantification of visual
    appearance and corresponding measurement setups. The outcome of research in this
    area is significant for industrial sectors where the measurement of visual appearance
    is important and for manufacturers of measurement equipment.\nDuring this joint
    symposium of CIE Divisions 1 and 2 presentations were given on:\n• the state of
    the art in our understanding of the perception of the visual attributes, such
    as colour, texture, translucency and gloss;\n• the latest achievements in the
    fields of novel measurement methodologies such as BRDF, BTDF, BSSRDF and others;\n•
    possible applications of visual appearance knowledge and novel measurement methodologies
    for the design and characterization of modern optical surfaces."
