    In April 2014 the Lighting Quality & Energy Efficiency Conference took place in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The event gave academics, lighting industry professionals, designers, researchers and representatives of regulatory authorities the opportunity to discuss best practice and the latest developments in the field of light and illumination. Recommendations were also made for reducing the amount of energy used for lighting. One of the hottest topics at the conference was light emitting diodes (LEDs), which offer significant environmental and energy-efficiency benefits compared with conventional lamps.

    The Proceedings of this Conference include invited papers and papers of the oral and poster presentations.
