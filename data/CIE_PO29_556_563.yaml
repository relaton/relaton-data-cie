abstract:
- content: Due to the neglect of design and the lack of relevant specification for
    domestic temporary exhibition lighting and so on, the result of the phenomenon
    of light source irrational use has been more serious. Light pollution and energy
    waste problem are also important issues that must be solved urgently. As a green
    energy-saving lighting, LED lighting can meet the demand of the exhibition space
    lighting well, which has timeliness, openness and mobility characteristics. With
    the luminous flux and luminous efficiency of high-power LED continues to improve,
    the advantages of the application of exhibition lighting has been gradually highlighted.
    Through the investigation and analysis of the lighting status in temporary exhibition
    space, we analyse and summarize the main problems and put forward the relevant
    solutions.
