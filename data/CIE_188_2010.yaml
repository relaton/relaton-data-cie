    This report has been produced to meet the need for a standardised, accurate
    and reliable method of assessing the photometric performance of vehicle
    headlights. It considers the requirements of headlight performance in terms of
    road scene illumination and limitation of glare, and the assessment of
    performance in terms of lane guidance and the detection of pedestrians and
    objects. The work undertaken to define the assessment method is
    summarised along with the results of the validation testing. A standardised
    photometric assessment method and calculation procedure for use by
    manufacturers and assessment organisations is provided.
    The publication is written in English, with a short summary in French and
    German. It consists of 86 pages with 85 figures and 8 tables.
