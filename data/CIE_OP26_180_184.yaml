    This article describes two field studies carried out in parallel, in two European cities, to investigate the relationship between lighting and reassurance. Given that using only ratings of reassurance carried out only after dark tend to lead to the trivial result that more light is better, these studies used the day-dark approach proposed by Boyce et al. The results suggest that horizontal and cylindrical illuminance are highly correlated: we therefore use horizontal illuminance. For a difference along the day-dark scale of 0.5 units, with ratings
    captured using a 1-6 rating scale, these results suggest optimum illuminances of 7.0 lux and 10.0 lux.
