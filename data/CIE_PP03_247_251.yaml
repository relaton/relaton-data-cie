abstract:
- content: The working hours for modern people are quite long, and lighting in work
    environment would intangibly affect people physiologically and psychologically
    to perform on work effectiveness. The lighting in work environment is therefore
    primary. Double Signal Dynamic Taguchi Methods is used in this study for the parameter
    design for optimum office lighting. Colour temperature and illumination are the
    double signal factors in the experimental design, and arrangement of ambient luminaire
    and wall colour change are the controlling factors. Furthermore, electroencephalogram
    and heart rate variability are regarded as the physiological parameters for objective
    evaluation, and questionnaire is the subjective evaluation. According to the research
    results, 1 arrangement of lighting, with the lighting design of colour temperature
    4000 K, low illumination 500 lx, matched with the arrangement of luminaire 1,
    is proposed, and the secondary light source is matched to adjust the lighting
    to colour temperature 5300 K and illumination 700 lx.
