abstract:
- content: Visual appearance of building finishing materials is one of the most important
    factors for the total impression of a room. It is evaluated through the sense
    of vision, touch, smell and hearing. Among them, it is considered that the sense
    of vision contributes largely to the visual impression of a room. This study is
    aimed to be a foundation for a suggestion of the evaluation index of visual appearance.
    Two experiments and 4 measurements were held to clarify the evaluation index for
    the visual appearance and the tactile texture. As a result, five evaluation index
    were extracted, gloss, roughness, warmth, softness and dryness.
