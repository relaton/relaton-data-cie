abstract:
- content: "In this publication the recommendations of the CIE Division 2 \"Physical
    Measurement of Light and Radiation\" are given on the definition of geometries
    for the measurement of the colour of materials and the tolerances around those
    fundamental definitions that are required to provide an expected level of accuracy
    and reproducibility. \n\nThis publication documents, for the first time, definitive
    definitions of the geometric requirements for instrumental colour measurements.
    It further defines three levels of tolerances which will provide three ranges
    of accuracy and reproducibility so as to clearly define what is required for the
    highest level of inter-laboratory agreement and what will be acceptable for industrial
    or commercial applications of basic colorimetry. \n\nThe terms and symbols used
    in this report are intended to be consistent with the existing standards in the
    International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) and in particular with ISO
    standards 5-1 and 5-4."
