abstract:
- content: Many industrial applications within the printing, cosmetic, automotive
    and clothing sectors deal with gonioapparent targets, whose appearance depends
    on illumination and viewing angles. The gonioapparent effect of these targets
    is usually presented with the bidirectional reflectance distribution function
    (BRDF). In this study, we visualize the BRDF data of a diffraction grating, a
    CD, a DVD and three different gonioapparent textiles, as sRGB images under D65
    illuminant. The study shows that the sRGB images could be used to visually inspect
    the differences in the sample surface structure and with textiles the colour of
    threads which compose the sample. This study was aimed to use commonly available
    samples and shows that their sRGB images could be used even by non-experts to
    visually compare different structures, colours, orientations and periods of the
    samples. The results also indicate that the sRGB images could also be used to
    extract the grating period of the diffractive sample surfaces. Moreover, images
    of knitted and woven textiles are distinguished.
