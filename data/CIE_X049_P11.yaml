abstract:
- content: The applied numerical calculations to determine the stroboscopic effect
    visibility measure (SVM) of a specific temporal light modulation waveform will
    influence the uncertainty of the determined value. An investigation of the achievable
    uncertainty under application of zero-padding and quadratic interpolation for
    peak finding is performed. This is done for sinusoidal and square verification
    waveforms outlined in IEC TR 63158 and demonstrates that using the referenced
    Stroboscopic effect visibility measure toolbox gives deviations from the reference
    values of up to 2.2%. Applying a combined optimised method of zero-padding and
    quadratic interpolation deviations less than 0.05% are achieved and yielding consitent.
    Result over different sampling frequencies. The verification waveforms are generated
    on a programmable light modulator and measurement results are shown.
