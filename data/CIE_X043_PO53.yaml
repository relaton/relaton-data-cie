abstract:
- content: The use of LED lighting has become widespread. LED light sources are manufactured
    in the primary colours of red, green, and blue, and are able to reproduce most
    chromatic colours. Chromatic colour lighting is considered to have physical and
    psychological effects on humans. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate
    the work efficiency affected by chromatic colour lighting. White, red, green,
    blue, yellow lighting were used in this experiment and six different tasks were
    conducted. The result is suggested that White and yellow lighting are suitable
    for thinking work, and green lighting is suitable for creative work.
