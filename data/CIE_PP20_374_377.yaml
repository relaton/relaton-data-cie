abstract:
- content: We experimentally demonstrate the concept of the spectrally variable source
    whose spectral distribution can be controlled via spatial transmission pattern.
    We built a proto-type setup consisting of a super-continuum white-light source,
    a Powell lens for generation of the lineshape beam, a spatially variable spectral
    filter for the wavelength-to-position transition, and a transmissive LCD display
    as the computer-assisted spatial light modulator. The experimental results show
    the control of spectral distribution in a range from 470 nm to 650 nm via 15 spectral
    channels with a resolution of approximately 15 nm. The results confirm the feasibility
    of the concept and indicate technical issues for improvement towards a programmable
    source generating any arbitrary spectral distribution in the whole visible range,
    which can be a useful tool for colour and vision experiments.
