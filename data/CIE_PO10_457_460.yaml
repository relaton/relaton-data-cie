abstract:
- content: To more definitely understand the effect of lighting on humans, the ergonomic
    study on health lighting has been discussed. Both subjective and non-subjective
    evaluations were implemented for obtaining the influence of different lighting
    conditions on human. The correlations between subjective evaluation and non-subjective
    evaluation is mentioned in this study. The subjective evaluation result revealed
    that most participants presented concentration and being excited, while the non-subjective
    evaluation showed that participants were enhanced the sympathetic activity indicator
    and the indexes of brain waves and reduced the parasympathetic activity indicator.
    Grey relational analysis is applied to analyse the correlations between subjective
    evaluation and non-subjective evaluation to control and stabilize the quality
    of experiment, expecting to reduce the variation between subjective and non-subjective
    experiment results and enhance the accuracy of experiment through such correlations.
    Furthermore, it is expected to establish a reliable model for the development
    of human-centric lighting in the future.
