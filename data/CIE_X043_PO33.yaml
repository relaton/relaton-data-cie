abstract:
- content: There are numerous factors that can influence when the sparkle texture
    effect is perceived such as the size, shape, thickness and orientation of the
    special-effect pigment, its chemical composition and number and thickness of layers,
    pigment concentration, hue, chroma and lightness of the coating sample, etc. In
    this work we will focus on the type (morphology) and the size (D50) of the pigment,
    and how they affect these variables when sparkle (glint or glitter) is visually
    detected. The first hypothesis of this work is to study what kind of pigment shape
    is detected at a longer distance for the observer, and the second one is to evaluate
    how the pigment size influences on the sparkle detection distance. Subsequently
    a comparison of the results of the visual experiment with the instrumental values
    provided by the BYK-mac multi-angle spectrophotometer is performed, to study whether
    there is a correlation between what predicts the commercial device and our eyes
    perceive.
