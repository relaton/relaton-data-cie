    This work is a result of a renewed activity of the CIE in the field of brightness as defined as the psychological attribute. The Commission started its duties with the compilation of a classified bibliography the results of which may be found in this publication.

    The bibliography consists of two parts:

        * An alphabetical part listing all first authors for quick reference
        * A classified part.

    The following items are covered in the classified part of the bibliography:

       1. Methodology brightness (contrast) measurement
              * brightness and contrast scaling
              * brightness and contrast matching
              * indirect brightness and contrast determination
       2. Brightness (contrast)-luminance relations for static stimuli
              * for relatively simple configurations
              * for complex scenes (luminance reproduction curve)
       3. Brightness (contrast)-luminance relations for dynamic stimuli
              * for time dependent stimuli
              * followed in the time domain
       4. Lightness-tone relations
              * for relatively simple stimuli
              * for complex scenes (ambient lighting, wavelength, surround luminance)
       5. Brightness (contrast) and spatial aspects
              * contour effects
       * surround
              * retinal location
              * sharpness/frequency
              * luminance gradient
       6. Brightness (contrast) of a point source
              * effects of intensity
              * background luminance
       7. Brightness (contrast) and state of adaptation; after images
              * background luminance
              * preadaptation
              * duration
       8. Brightness (contrast) models
              * scaling models
              * effects of spatial parameters
              * dynamic models
       9. Various
              * binocular brightness, interocular effects
              * colour, Helmholz, Kohlrausch, Troxler's effect
              * special apparatus

    This publication contains 173 pages.

    This Classified Bibliography on Brightness-Luminance Relations has been compiled by J.A.J. Roufs (The Netherlands) and R.M. Smith (USA).
