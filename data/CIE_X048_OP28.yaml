abstract:
- content: Temporal light modulation (TLM) and the resulting temporal light artefacts
    (TLA) can cause problems with health and wellbeing for users of lighting products.
    Therefore, TLM has to be measured accurately and repeatably. This study investigates
    important factors influencing the measurement uncertainty of TLM measurements.
    The study shows how measurement uncertainty on central TLM parameters can have
    a significant effect on the calculation of TLA. Specifically, we show a linear
    relationship between DC offset and the expected error. Further we show severe
    effects of random noise on PstLM on certain waveforms. And lastly, we show a curious
    effect related to SVM of pulse width modulated signals and the measurement sampling
    frequency.
