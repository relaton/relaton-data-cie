    The emerging use of Charge Coupled Device (CCD) detectors and frame grabbers in image processing evidently created the challenge to capture all of the available photometric information within a relatively large field of view on the road, but to the same level of spatial resolution as that of a conventional luminance-meter. Most conventional luminance-meters sample only a relatively small area of the environment. Using CCD arrays, large scenes can be captured and converted to digital photometric information. The complexity of such scenes preclude the use of conventional photometric technology since the amount of labour and time involved in obtaining the huge number of measurement data would be prohibitive. CCD based photometers compared to the single cell photodetectors have to cope not only with the spectral matching, uniformity and linearity problem, to mention only the most important ones, but with additional problems, like viewing angle, vignetting, etc.

    In the mid 90's the CIE Technical Committee 4-26 "Systems for Measurement of Photometric Quantities of Road Lighting Installations" of the CIE Division 4 "Lighting and Signalling for Transport" dedicated two workshops and intercomparisons to this topic. The material of the workshops, included in these proceedings, gives an overview on the different types of realization of the mobile and static systems for the measurement of photometric quantities of road lighting in different countries. The realized systems gave the possibility to extend the measured photometric quantities beyond luminance and illuminance to determine chromaticity coordinates, to evaluate disability glare or to analyse the theoretical aspects of the moving observer.

    The Proceedings contain the text of the papers provided by the speakers. The publication consists of 114 pages.
