abstract:
- content: In this study, the photometry of a wide range of classic and innovative
    pavements used in urban and interurban areas were characterised both when new
    and after 30 months of natural aging. An extreme diversity of behaviour with respect
    to light reflection was revealed both over time and between pavements. The simulations
    of relamping cases show that the use of typical CIE r-tables almost systematically
    leads to non-compliance with the EN 13201 standard, particularly in terms of uniformity.
    Taking the photometry of the pavement at its stabilized state into account, simultaneously
    allows for compliance with lighting safety issues and for significant energy savings.
    As measurements of pavement photometry are rarely carried out, an alternative
    is to build up a database of urban pavements, which is one of the objectives of
    the Pavements and Lighting working group.
