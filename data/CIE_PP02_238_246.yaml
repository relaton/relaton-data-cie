abstract:
- content: Aim of this paper is to contribute to improvement of the methodology for
    determination and application of the maintenance factor of lighting systems. The
    paper is specifically focused on the room surface maintenance factor (RSMF) in
    interior lighting. The paper consist of three selfstanding parts. In first part
    it is proposed to release the current structure of maintenance factor and to split
    it to luminaire related and surface related degradation factors. To support update
    of RSMF values for different environmental condition, sample surfaces have been
    let polluted by dust and dirt and their reflectance have been measured in stated
    time intervals. Third, model calculations for a mock-up room under different conditions
    have been evaluated, once using the current approach and alternatively associating
    the RSMF factor directly with room surface reflectances.
