    In this study, we aimed to clarify the influence of colour temperature on learning. We conducted two experiments, the first of which investigated the influence of colour temperature on learning efficiency, and the second of which examined the effects of changing colour
    temperature during adaptation at lighting environments on subsequent learning. The results of our experiments suggest that 4000 K is suitable for memory and sentence-related tasks, and that changing the colour temperature from 3000 K to 5000 K by the start of the tasks increased alertness. Especially, it is noted that the change may be even more effective if it occurs one minute before the task start.
