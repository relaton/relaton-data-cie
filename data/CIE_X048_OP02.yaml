abstract:
- content: Photoluminescent paints for road marking have been evaluated through laboratory
    measurements and visibility computations. The luminance decay in the dark was
    measured after constant excitation during at least six hours. To study the effect
    of night-time lighting conditions, luminance was also measured under a constant
    low illumination simulating moon and light pollution, and a periodic lighting
    simulating automotive traffic. Measurements were also carried out on luminescent
    road markings applied in a full scale mock up. Then, possible uses and limits
    of photoluminescent road markings were investigated through visibility computations
    based on the COST 331 model. Findings suggest that luminescent road markings could
    strengthen the visual guidance of drivers on the road with traffic by increasing
    the visibility distance beyond the range of the headlamps during the first few
    hours of the night, but it depends on the night-time illumination level.
