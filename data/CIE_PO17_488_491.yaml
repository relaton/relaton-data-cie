abstract:
- content: Sensing the light of colour deviation by colour sensor was studied. Comparing
    with a standard spectrometer, we could achieve fewer errors by utilizing colour
    correction to correct chromaticity coordinates and illuminance. Further, compensation
    method testing under different multispectral LED is performed.
