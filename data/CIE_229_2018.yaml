abstract:
- content: The objective of this report is to lay the groundwork for developing a
    recommendation on the measurement of effective intensity of flashing lights used
    for signalling applications. It recommends a convolutional method that will rest
    on some defined visual impulse response function to calculate the effectivity
    intensity. As one of such realizations of convolutional methods, the Modified
    Allard Method with an infinite time window is described. However it is not yet
    an official recommendation due to the lack of experimental verification and the
    need for further research. This report also provides guidance on physical measurements
    of effective intensity for the described method, for flashing lights using any
    type of light sources including xenon flash tubes, light emitting diodes (LEDs)
    and rotating beacons, which produce pulse widths in the range from microseconds
    to seconds. This report does not cover specific measurement requirements for signalling
    light products. While this document refers to flashing lights, the described method
    applies also to occulting lights, isophase lights, and groups of flashes of varying
    duration.
