abstract:
- content: This report offers guidelines in order to balance lighting quality, user
    comfort and energy efficiency in lighting controls solutions for lighting in non-residential
    buildings (i.e. for commercial, institutional and industrial buildings). It provides
    a decision scheme with a focus on the user requirements (visual comfort, performance,
    personal control) to determine the most applicable control solution, including
    the consequences for possible savings. In this, it assumes that there are no technological
    or financial hurdles. The decision scheme identifies 16 possible control strategies,
    for both daylight and electric lighting, and provides guidance for which strategy
    would be most effective in each of the 12 cases defined by space usage and occupancy.
