    The colour appearance of five familiar objects were investigated under spectrally optimised test sources and reference white LEDs. A mixture of seven narrowband LEDs was used as test sources to minimise the energy absorbed by the coloured objects. The perceived fidelity and preference for the colour appearance of five objects of different hues (i.e. red, yellow, orange, green and blue) were investigated experimentally. The results show that absorption-minimising spectra do not negatively impact object appearance. A higher tolerance for colour shift was found when the preference of object colours was judged. Although the energy savings were relatively low, the data from the psychophysical experiments supports the feasibility of
    optimising light sources for object reflectance.
