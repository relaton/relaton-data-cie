abstract:
- content: Experiments were conducted to develop a sleeping light that can create
    cosy and relaxing atmosphere and to improve the sleeping quality at night. The
    results showed that people feel more relaxed and sleepy in a low saturated Red-Yellow
    light than a phase of daylight.
