abstract:
- content: Japanese women's facial skin colour has varied through time, lightening
    from the early 1990s to the early 2000s. However, since the early 2000s, facial
    skin colour changes have hardly been investigated quantitatively. The aim of this
    study was to investigate Japanese women's facial skin colour changes over 25 years
    by analysing differences in skin reflectance measured with three different spectrophotometer
    models. First, a specific facial part's skin colour was measured with three different
    spectrophotometers, and correction equations were established to compare the skin
    colour data by confirming differences in output spectral reflectance. Next, cheek
    skin colour measurements of approximately 2,000 Japanese women from 2005 and 2015
    were compared with corrected 1991 and 2001 data. The results showed that Japanese
    women's skin colour has lessened in chroma and become more reddish since 2000.
    Especially, women in their 20s have shown remarkable changes.
