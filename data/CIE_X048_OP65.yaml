abstract:
- content: In research of lighting for pedestrians, many experiments have been conducted
    to determine how changes in lighting affect the ability to make interpersonal
    evaluations. Here we consider an alternative approach, predicting performance
    using a model - Relative Visual Performance. The results show that face evaluation
    ability is affected by adaptation luminance and also by personal characteristics;
    observer age and skin tone of the observed person. While 2 lx is sufficient for
    a young observer to evaluate a Caucasian face, the typical situation in laboratory
    trials, higher illuminances are needed for older observers and for darker skin
    tones.
