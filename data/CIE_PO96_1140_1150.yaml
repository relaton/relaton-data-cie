abstract:
- content: 'This research is based on objective characteristics of our country to
    investigate and analyse the public light pollution. It would affect the degree
    of awareness and discomfort of public feeling. Reviews of the relevant light pollution
    regulations and anal yses of the current petition cases, this research focuses
    on two major light pollution sources to investigate the subjective perception
    of glare and flicker for LED multimedia. The main tasks include: (1) perform subjective
    evaluation of glare and flicker at night condition to build up the borderline
    between comfort and discomfort (BCD) of human perception for LED billboard in
    outdoor environment; (2) conduct field experiment and field survey to propose
    the standard operation procedure; (3) propose predictive improvement and management
    programs for LED multimedia according to the international regulations and domestic
    situation. A total of 24 participants took part in this field experiment in the
    atrium of the Management School of Tunghai University, Taichun g, Taiwan, and
