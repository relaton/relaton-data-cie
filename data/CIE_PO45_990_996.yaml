abstract:
- content: To estimate the amount of measurement error according to panel size, we
    conducted a simulation to estimate the change of the total luminous flux using
    an integrating sphere due to panel size. The effects of distribution of the standard
    lamp, position of the panel source, and shadow area behind the panel source were
    also investigated. Results show that the light distribution of standard lamp of
    2Ï€ sr Lambertian is preferable. It was also confirmed that an ideal estimated
    value could be calculated even with a panel size some larger than 10% of the diameter
    of IS. This suggests a possibility to increase a size limit of test light source.
