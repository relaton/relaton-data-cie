abstract:
- content: Quality indexes are usually defined for measurement instruments in order
    to characterize some specific aspect of their performance. The V(A) spectral mismatch
    of photometers is evaluated by the general V(A) mismatch index, f1, whose value
    must be correlated with the average measurement error introduced by this spectral
    mismatch. The objective of this work is to assess the correlation of several indexes
    of this type with this average error of photometers. The difference between the
    studied indexes is that the spectral responsivity of the photometer is normalized
    with different factors to that defined for f1.  From this study, we conclude that
    the most suitable normalization in the definition of a f1-type quality index is
    not determined by the spectral distribution used in the calibration or by those
    of the light sources to be measured. The normalization factor presenting the best
    correlation in all studied cases was obtained by numerically minimizing the value
    of the index instead of by applying an explicit function,  as it is done in f1.
