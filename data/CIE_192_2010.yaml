    This publication discusses the state-of-the-art of practical daylight sources for
    colorimetry. It provides information on these lamps and devices used for illumination
    in the visual evaluation and instrumental measurement of non-fluorescent and
    fluorescent specimens.
    Suppliers of lamps, booths and spectrophotometers provided some of the data on
    daylight sources. TC members and advisors at four institutions measured the rest.
    These institutions are the University of Derby (UK), the Hong Kong Polytechnic
    University (Hong Kong, China), the University of Pannonia (Veszprem, Hungary) and
    SENAI/CETIQT (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil).
    The report concludes from these data that practical daylight sources are
    commercially available that satisfy the criteria of the relevant national and
    international standards for both visual evaluation and instrumental measurement.
    Filtered tungsten, filtered xenon and fluorescent lamps currently provide the best
    results for visual evaluation. Pulsed filtered xenon provides the best results for
    instrumental measurements. Light-emitting diode (LED) sources may appear as
    viable alternatives for both applications in the not too distant future.
    Standardization of any particular source as "best representing daylight" is not
    recommended. There are significant differences between the spectral properties of
    the sources currently used in visual evaluation and the sources used in instrumental
    measurement. These differences produce large differences in the rendering of
    colours of specimens, especially fluorescent specimens.
