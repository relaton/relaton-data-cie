abstract:
- content: Conventional discomfort glare measures are based on glare source properties
    like luminous intensity or luminance and typically are valid only to specific
    situations and to specific types of light sources. For instance, the Unified Glare
    Rating (UGR) is intended for indoor lighting conditions with medium-sized glare
    sources, whereas another class of discomfort glare measures is specifically devoted
    to car headlamps. Recently, CIE TC 3-57 started with the aim to develop a more
    generic glare sensation model based on the human visual system. We present an
    example of such a model, including a detailed description of aspects like pupil
    constriction, retinal image formation, photoreceptor response and adaptation,
    receptive field-type filtering in the retina, and neural spatial summation. The
    linear correlation of the model to UGR in an indoor setting, and to subjective
    glare responses in an outdoor-like setting indicate that the human-visual-system-based
    model may indeed be considered generic.
