abstract:
- content: The purpose of this paper is to clarify the evaluation structure of the
    preference for the visibility of paintings, taking into account the characteristics
    of paintings with low reflectance. Although illuminance is used in the standards
    for museum lighting (CIE 157:2004), it is desirable to design lighting that also
    considers luminance from the viewpoint of perceived brightness. Therefore, we
    conducted the subjective experiment of oil paintings in which luminance ratio
    was set as an experimental variable and examined the evaluation structure of paintings
    with low reflectance. As a result, it was found that the evaluation of black details
    affects the preference for the visibility of paintings with low reflectance. However,
    the path diagram of the evaluation structure applied to each painting was different,
    indicating that it is difficult to represent the characteristics of a painting
    only by the mean reflectance.
