abstract:
- content: With the advance of LED technology, it is envisaged that spectrum tuneable
    lighting systems (STLS) will be widely spread in the lighting related research
    environment. The STLS brings a new dimension to the appearance research. This
    paper introduced a series of research works using these lighting systems, including
    white light locus, whiteness metrics, colour rendering metrics, metamerism index,
    preferred skin colours, museum lighting, colour discrimination metric, multispectral
    imaging system.
