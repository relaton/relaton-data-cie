abstract:
- content: 'The use of artificial light at night in the outdoor environment may introduce
    negative and unwanted side-effects such as light pollution and unwanted impacts
    on humans, ecosystems and biodiversity. Therefore, appropriate measures for reducing
    the adverse effects of artificial light at night are important to establish a
    sustainable use of outdoor lighting. This paper presents an updated overview and
    a state-of-the-art of available and effective measures for reducing artificial
    light at night, which range from strategical and high-level recommendations to
    more practical and applicable lighting design recommendations and principles.
    Another aim is to identify prioritized future research questions and areas that
    will enhance progress within the area. We present the current recommendations
    into three groups: (I) recommendations for legislation at the national or international
    levels, (II) recommendations for technical and practical adaptations of the lighting
    design and (III) recommendations for sensitive species, taxa, areas or ecosystems.'
