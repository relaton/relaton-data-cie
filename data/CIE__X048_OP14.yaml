abstract:
- content: There is only little guidance available for the evaluation of the degree
    of equivalence for higher dimensional measurands, especially in respect to tristimulus
    values. Currently, the tristimulus values are usually treated as one-dimensional
    measurand in order to simplify the degree of equivalence evaluation and be able
    to use the well-known procedures and statistics known from one-dimensional measurands.
    As the tristimulus values are clearly a high-dimensional measurand, they should
    be treated in that way. In the following, a procedure for the degree of equivalence
    evaluation for high-dimensional measurands is presented where the Monte Carlo
    method is used to support a clear understanding of the procedure. In addition
    to the procedure, the limitations of this method are discussed in regard to tristimulus
    values.
