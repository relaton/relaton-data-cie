abstract:
- content: In this paper, we present a non-bilateral symmetrical elliptical mirror
    (NBSEM) for optical blood glucose concentration detection, and can effectively
    improve the ability to receive near-infrared light (NIR) than conventional optical
    non-invasive blood glucose measuring module (ONBGM). In order to verify the performance
    of different modules, we built a simple human skin model which includes epidermis,
    dermis and subcutaneous base on the Henyey-Greenstein scattering model, to compare
    the optical efficiency under different modules. According to the analysis results,
    the optical efficiency of the ONBGM with the NBSEM is better than the conventional
    ONBGM.
