abstract:
- content: Since the discovery of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion
    cells, there has been a renewed view on the processes that lead to a light induced
    pupil dilatation. To predict the pupil diameter, a large number of models have
    been established which are in general based on the luminance as a light photometric
    parameter. In this work we investigate how the pupil responds to different polychromatic
    spectra at constant luminance and brightness according to models of Fotios et
    al. and Berman. The results indicate that especially under photopic conditions,
    the pupil diameter has significant differences between the used spectra. The use
    of the brightness model according to Fotios et al. improves this (F(2,22) = 87.76,
    p < .05.) compared to a constant luminance (F(2, 22) = 522.05, p < .05), but statistical
    differences still exist. Under mesopic conditions using the Berman-brightness-model
    no significant differences in pupil diameters can be determined with F(1.11, 7.78)
    = 1.61, p > .05.
