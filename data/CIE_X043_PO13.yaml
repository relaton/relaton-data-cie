abstract:
- content: 'Nowadays it is a trend to use high chromacitycolours. These colours are
    using in many applications such as: warning clothes, fashion design and decorative
    cosmetics. Many companies were focusing on these colours due to high market potential.
    Therefore, it is important to study these colours and small differences between
    these colours. In many cases, the light sources change in LED light source due
    to it having the ecological and economical aspect. These changes bring lots of
    problems; discrimination of small colour differences is one among the problems.
    International Commission on Illumination (CIE) defined a space called CIELAB,
    which isn''t visual uniform. Based on the previous studies, the data for development
    and testing of new colour difference formulas and colour spaces are limited in
    chroma. In this work, we were using high chroma dataset for testing and prediction
    the performance of known colour difference formulas. For testing, we used grey
    scale and source emitted daylight simulator (D65) and full spectral LED light
    source. This work has been compared with visual colour difference form observers
    and calculated colour difference from spectrophotometer. From this study, we made
    a data set of yellow-green region with high chomacity. Observer was comparingthese
    data set under D65 and VLED light source. The data set was compared with spectrophotometer
    data. Present research is to evaluate the prediction ability for different colour-difference
    formulas in high chroma, particularly yellow-green region of CIELAB colour space.
    Various colour-difference formulae, such as CIELAB, CMC, and CIE94, have been
    developed in order to facilitate the determination of instrumental tolerances
    and the measurement of colour difference. These formulae have been developed by
    analysing the results from visual experiments that have been employed in a variety
    of techniques for determining the colour differences which based on acceptability
    or perceptibility. Nevertheless, such optimization is limited to the chroma value
    from the previous studies on visual experiments. Based on these results, centre
    of high chroma yellow-green colour is used as starting point of wide visual experiment
    related to high Chroma colours. The grey-scale comparison method was used to determine
    the colour tolerances for high chroma yellow-green colour canter in the hue, chroma,
    and lightness directions in CIELAB colour space. The performance of the visual
    differences and of the calculated colour difference of three colour-difference
    formulas of CIELAB, CMC, CIE94 are calculated by: Standardized residual sum of
    square (STRESS), performance factor(PF), correlation coefficient (COQ) and a number
    of wrong decisions (WDC).'
