abstract:
- content: "This Technical Report reviews the CIE international recommendations for
    the colours of signal lights. The CIE recommendations for signal colours were
    first adopted in 1951 and were revised in 1975. They have not since been subject
    to critical review in the light of new experimental evidence and changed technology.
    Published and unpublished reports of experiments on the recognition of signal
    colours were compiled and analysed. The data from those reports were brought on
    to a common base for dim signals, moderately bright signals and bright signals
    under conditions simulating both night and day observation. Some of the experiments
    included subjects with defective colour vision. Consideration of the data by the
    Committee and its expert advisors has lead to a number of recommendations for
    changes to the internationally accepted colour domains for signal colours, notably:\n\n
    \  1. Restriction of the yellow boundary of red, abandonment of the restricted
    purple boundary of red and re-definition of the recommended red in signal systems
    used by persons with defective colour vision;\n   2. Substantial re-definition
    of the colour domain for yellow including the definition of special domains for
    yellow signals of high and low illuminance;\n   3. Restriction of the boundaries
    of the colour domain for green;\n   4. Amendment of the colour domain for white
    including the definition of a preferred domain and a secondary domain that can
    be used when there is little chance of confusion with white lights;\n   5. Restricting
    the green and white boundaries of blue to enhance recognition as well as defining
    a more desaturated blue that can be used when there is little chance of confusion
    with white and a special domain to be used for low illuminance blue signals;\n
    \  6. Recommending the abandonment of violet as a signal colour. \n\nBased on
    this report CIE will publish an International Standard on \"Colours of Signal
    Lights\". The publication contains 42 pages, 14 figures and 6 tables."
