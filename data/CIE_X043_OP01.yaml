abstract:
- content: 'Two perception experiments exploring the relation between chromaticity
    of illumination and perceived whiteness are presented. Relative whiteness was
    measured using a two alternative forced choice methodology with constant points.
    Adaptation to a point in between the forced choice stimuli was used. In the experiments,
    carried out with both expert and naive participants, it is demonstrated that the
    points that are perceived to be the whitest for CCTs of 2700 K, 4100 K, and 5000
    K, are located 0.003 to 0.008 Âµ v below the BBL. Thus, there is a possibility
    of specifying a white body line to characterize light sources. However, a comparison
    of the results with the previously reported studies: Ohno (2014) and Rea (2011),
    points towards the need of more extensive discussions on basic questions and methodologies
    used.'
