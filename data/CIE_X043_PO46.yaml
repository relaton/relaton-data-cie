abstract:
- content: 'In this paper, we will demonstrate a comparison between measured colorimetric
    images, and simulated images from a physics based rendering engine. The colorimetric
    images are high dynamic range (HDR) and taken with a luminance and colour camera
    mounted on a goniometer. For the comparison, we have used a scene similar to the
    cornel box but with a spectrally controllable LED light source, neutral grey walls
    and a colour checker board for colorimetric assessments. The luminance value and
    colour information of the HDR camera and rendering images are used for the comparison.
    The spectral irradiances of the light source were measured for two lighting scenarios:
    low and high correlated colour temperature (CCT) white lighting conditions for
    the modelling of the light source. Based on these measurements, we have conducted
    spectrally resolved renderings with a spectral renderer, Ocean. The colour differences
    between the camera and rendered images were calculated with the most recent CIE
    metric, CIEDE2000.  Our simulations have demonstrated interesting results, which
    confirm the accuracy of the Ocean engine. In the future, we want to consider non-Lambertian
    surfaces.'
