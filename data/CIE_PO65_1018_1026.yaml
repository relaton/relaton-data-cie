abstract:
- content: This research aims to find the range of pleasantness, darkness and brightness
    in a lighting environment in a restaurant, using three lighting methods and assuming
    four behaviours with different visual focuses. Adjustment method was used to derive
    the threshold value. Experimental results showed that a range of pleasant darkness
    exists, and also that there is a possibility of a range of unpleasant brightness.
    Pleasantness, darkness and brightness judgements were affected by types of behaviour,
    lighting methods and subjects. Instead of calculating the average, logistic analysis
    was conducted to derive positive response rate of 50% as a threshold value. Lighting
    environmental indexes are also considered with each behaviour. Use of luminance
    values may compromise the differences caused by the lighting method. Experimental
    results were compared with the standard values and indicated that pleasantness
    may also be found in darker environments.
