abstract:
- content: This experiment is to explore the relationship between the screen brightness
    and ambient brightness, and extend the difference between the screen to adjust
    the brightness sensor. In this study, four sets of ambient lighting were used
    in a room where the observer was asked to evaluate the readability and visual
    comfort read on the laptop screen and to look for 30 men and women who were half
    of the test. The results show that the current brightness sensor is not just a
    positive reception light source can be more in-depth discussion to detect different
    directions of light to adjust the screen brightness.
