abstract:
- content: This document establishes a recommended procedure for gonioradiometric
    measurements of UVGI luminaires in the far field. The methodology described in
    this document applies to incoherent lamp and lamp systems (luminaires) emitting
    in the UV-C wavelength region from 200 nm to 280 nm.NOTE The dominant source used
    for UVGI is the low-pressure mercury (LPM) lamp, but other sources, such as LEDs
    and Excimer lamps, are also being used for UVGI luminaires.This document does
    not specify the radiant exposures required for disinfection. Reference should
    be made to CIE 155:2003 (CIE 2003) for the radiant exposure levels required to
    disinfect specific pathogens.
