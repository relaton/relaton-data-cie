abstract:
- content: A new criterion for the illumination quality based on the gradient of the
    luminance distribution on the scene is proposed. The possibility of obtaining
    a space-angular luminance distribution based on the solution simulation of the
    global illumination equation using local estimations of the Monte Carlo method
    is shown. The experimental installation allowing to carry out researches in the
    field of illumination quality is presented.
