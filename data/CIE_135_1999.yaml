    Disability glare>\n\nOn the basis of a preceding theoretical analysis of experimental
    data on disability glare published in CIE Collection (Vos and Van den Berg, 1997),
    resulting in a complete glare equation covering the full 0° to 100° glare angle
    range, three simplified glare equations are presented, each of them defined for
    a more restricted glare angle domain. This ensemble of three equations together
    is recommended to define a CIE Standard Glare Observer; the most simple one, the
    Age Adapted Stiles-Holladay Equation, will suffice for most circumstances of daily
    practice.\n\nThis report was prepared by J.J. Vos, The Netherlands (TC 1-18 Chairman)\n\n135/2
    Colour rendering, closing remarks\n\nThe CIE \"Test method to calculate a colour
    rendering index\" has a long and complicated history. After first publishing a
    method in 1965 and updating it in 1974, it was soon realised that further amendments
    would be necessary. A TC worked on the subject in the 1980s, but had to be closed
    without any definite recommendation due to disagreements among the TC Members.
    A second trial was started after the 1991 Quadrennial Meeting. This TC worked
    - under various chairmen - for about six years, but again it had to be closed
    without producing a definite recommendation, although this time TC Members agreed
    in a number of questions. This report summarizes those items where TC Members
    could agree and highlights also those questions where no consensus could be reached.
    To the latter category two groups of questions belong: items where it is hoped
    that CIE will come up very soon with further recommendations that should be incorporated
    in a colour rendering calculation (e.g. new chromatic adaptation transformation)
    and items where a political decision of the lamp manufacturers is needed, as a
    change in the calculation method necessarily will favour one lamp spectrum compared
    to that of an other. The present closing remarks document summarizes the items
    discussed by the TC during the past decade, states those items where a consensus
    could be formed and pinpoints questions where further research is needed to reach
    consensus.\n\nThis research note was prepared by J. Schanda, Hungary (TC 1-33
    Chairman)\n\n135/3 Virtual metamers for assessing the quality of simulators of
    CIE illuminant D50 (Supplement 1-1999 to CIE 51-1981)\n\nCIE 51-1981 describes
    a method of assessing the quality of simulators of CIE illuminants D55, D65, and
    D75 (various phases of daylight), for colour measuring instruments, visual appraisal
    and matching of colours. The spectral power distribution of the simulator is measured
    and the departure from the ideal distribution is computed, in terms of chromaticity
    differences between virtual metameric pairs that match under the ideal CIE illuminant.
    CIE illuminant D50 is simulated for use in photography and colour printing. This
    supplement provides the virtual metamers needed to apply the method of assessment
    to D50 simulators. \n\n135/4 Some recent developments in colour-difference evaluation\n\nA
    compressed overview is given of developments in colour-difference evaluation that
    trace back to the early beginnings by MacAdam. The correlation of colorimetric
    measures of coloured samples with judgements on small colour differences follows
    normal statistics, but in a three-dimensional space. A wide diversity of experimental
    conditions in investigations of the colour-difference effect made comparisons
    of different studies troublesome. Some external influential factors could be identified.
    Recently developed data sets resulted from much better control of experimental
    conditions. They form a new basis for deriving colour difference formulae. The
    CIE is the international body to encourage field research for optimising new colour-difference
    formulae. The various stages for recommending formulae and exchanging extensive
    investigation documents make a close link between practitioners and theorists,
    however, in general industrialists have a faster response. Nonetheless, the CIE
    still remains the mother-body for international discussion and agreement. Recent
    developments in colour-difference evaluation show an acceleration of the work
    of CIE TCs. Their studies first improved the CIELAB-formula, and second now try
    to fill the gap between the CIE94 and the older CMC(l:c) solutions. A new idea
    is introduced to optimise the formalism of a formula not at the components of
    differential terms, but at the co-ordinates which keeps the vector definition
    of colour-difference as in the CIELAB-formula. An international discussion is
    proposed on this aspect as a forthcoming step to further improvement of colour-difference
    evaluation.\n\nThis report was prepared by K. Witt, Germany\n\n135/5 Visual adaptation
    to complex luminance distribution\n\nOne of the most important and difficult tasks
    in evaluation of perceived brightness in everyday circumstances is to assess what
    level the visual system adapts to. Especially, this is an inevitable process when
    putting the new photometric system into practice. In the present report, several
    studies are reviewed, and tasks and problems of the prospective TC are discussed.
    Although many studies of brightness perception are potentially related to the
    matter of adaptation level, we can find no literature in which the issue is discussed
    explicitly. All what we can do now is to encourage investigators to carry out
    research concerning the level of visual adaptation not only in experimental conditions
    but also in natural and complex environments.\n\nThis research note was prepared

    (PTFE) powder (Reprint of NIST Technical Note 1413)\n\nPressed polytetrafluoroethylene
    (PTFE) powder is used for 45°/0° reflectance factor standards. The radiometric
    and spectrophotometric measurement community such as the Council for Optical Radiation
    Measurements (CORM) has demonstrated the need for such a standard and its application
    to quality control and quality assessment. This publication briefly describes
    the instrumentation used for the 45°/0° spectral reflectance factor measurements
    of pressed PTFE powder from 380 nm to 770 nm. Also, the variations of 45°/0° reflectance
    factor with sample preparation and materials are discussed. The expanded uncertainty
    at a coverage factor of two for the 45°/0° reflectance factors of pressed PTFE
    powder ranges from 0,009 to 0,017.\n\nThis report was prepared by P.Y. Barnes,
    USA and J.J. Hsia, USA (Reprint of NIST Technical Note 1413 July 1995)\n\nThe
    publication contains also abridged abstracts of CIE Publications prepared within
    Division 1 and 2.\n\nThese reports are written in English, with short summaries
    in French and German. The publication contains 78 pages."
