    This report makes recommendations for emergency lighting in road tunnels longer
    than 500 m, to facilitate the safe evacuation of vehicle occupants in emergency
    situations such as fire. The recommendations may also be valid for tunnels less than
    500 m in length, where conditions such as high traffic volume, or severe curvature or
    gradient apply. It The report addresses the fundamental issues of emergency lighting
    for evacuation routes, emergency exits, escape routes and lay-bys, as well as giving
    some practical advice regarding aspects of installation and maintenance in road
    tunnels. It recommends lighting levels and general provisions for emergency lighting
    installations that, based on experience, are considered to be necessary for the safety
    of people driving through road tunnels in case of an incident and particularly of fire.
    However, as there are different types of road tunnels, both in construction and traffic
    conditions and various types of incidents may occur, this report should be considered
    as a list of minimum recommendations for emergency lighting in tunnels, to be
    completed by means of specific risk analysis for the particular tunnel.

    This report is intended to be used in conjunction with CIE 88 (2nd revision - 2004
    or any further revision) or with relevant Regional or National standards, directives
    and regulations for road tunnel lighting. The latter may include requirements that
    differ from the recommendations of this report, and take priority over them. Before
    following the recommendations of the report in a particular location, the existence of
    any relevant legal requirements should be investigated.
