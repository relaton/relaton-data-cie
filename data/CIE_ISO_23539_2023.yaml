abstract:
- content: 'This document was revised by the International Commission on Illumination
    (CIE) and is now published in cooperation with Technical Committee ISO/TC 274,
    Light and lighting.This first edition of ISO/CIE 23539 cancels and replaces ISO
    23539:2005/CIE S 010:2004, which has been technically revised.The main changes
    are as follows:— The scope of the document has changed to incorporate the spectral
    luminous efficiency functions published by the CIE for a) mesopic vision and b)
    10° photopic vision, on the basis of CIE 018:2019.— The International System of
    Units (SI) and its reformulation of the definition of the candela – effective
    on 20 May 2019 – has been incorporated (Resolution 1, 26th CGPM, 2018).— A list
    of normative references has been added.— Specific requirements have been added
    regarding the use of units, tabulated values and interpolation of intermediate
    values.— The background of the CIE system of physical photometry, specifically
    the evolution of the photometric base unit, has been updated in Annex C.— The
    CIE 2015 cone-fundamental-based spectral luminous efficiency functions for a)
    2° field size and b) 10° field size have been added in Annex E based on CIE 170-2:2015.The
    purpose of photometry is to measure light as perceived by human eyes. The brightness
    of a luminous surface depends not only on the amount of radiation it emits, transmits
    or reflects, but also on its spectral composition and on the visual response function
    of the observer viewing it. Because human visual response varies at different
    light levels and from person to person, precise photometry requires the definition
    of representative standard observers. The CIE system of physical photometry specifies
    procedures for the quantitative evaluation of optical radiation in terms of internationally
    agreed spectral luminous efficiency functions for human vision. V(λ) represents
    photopic vision, V''(λ) represents scotopic vision and Vmes;m(λ) represents mesopic
    vision, the latter being intermediate between photopic and scotopic vision. Furthermore,
    V10(λ) represents 10° photopic vision. These luminous efficiency functions adopted
    from CIE 018:2019 and BIPM-2019/05, together with the SI base unit, the candela,
    constitute a system that enables the calculation of values of photometric quantities
    for optical radiation as well as light-emitting, light-transmitting or light-reflecting
    surfaces, to be precisely determined based on the International System of Units
    (SI), regardless of the spectral composition of the radiation emitted, transmitted
    or reflected.The CIE system of physical photometry has some limitations in respect
    to the brightness of coloured surfaces: two light sources of different colour
    but with the same measured luminance value will not necessarily be perceived as
    equally bright. CIE has therefore published a more complex model (CIE 200:2011)
    for specific situations. For eye-mediated non-image-formingeffects of light induced
    partially or completely by the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglioncells
    (ipRGCs), CIE S 026/E:2018 is used.'
