abstract:
- content: OLED is expected as one of the next generation lighting devices. As OLED
    panel is a planar surface-emitting lighting device, non-uniformity of OLED due
    to several production process and non-uniform current density is easily detected.
    Therefore, luminance uniformity inside the panel, and the angular dependent uniformity
    in chromaticity are both important aspects in assessing the performance of the
    OLED panel. We tried to find an evaluation index to assess the uniformity of the
    OLED panel based on human perception. We simulated several non-uniform patterns
    on a LCD monitor, asking subjects to evaluate the non-uniformity of the stimulus,
    and tried to find the threshold for the detection of the non-uniformity. Our results
    showed that the uniformity perception in luminance distribution was affected by
    the gradient patterns. In addition, patterns whose central area was brighter than
    its peripheral appeared more uniform. Our findings suggest that it is necessary
    to consider complexity of gradient pattern and the form of luminance distribution
    to make an evaluating model for uniformity perception.
