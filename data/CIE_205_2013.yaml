    With recent increases in luminous flux and efficacy, LEDs have started to compete with conventional light sources in luminaires for general lighting.  Typical LED characteristics, such as directional light, small size and high brightness are as such not new light source characteristics; nonetheless they are (alone or as combination) new characteristics in some areas of functional interior lighting, such as offices, class rooms, meeting rooms or patient rooms.  Most existing quality measures for those application are derived from research with and referring to the use of diffuse fluorescent lighting.  This report provides information on the suitability of existing lighting quality measures when applied to (commercial) interior LED lighting systems.  It identifies the gaps and weaknesses in existing quality measures, recommends new quality measures and includes suggestions for required research.

    This publication is written in English with a short summary in French and German.  It consists of 34 pages with 3 figures and 1 table.
