    There has long been a debate about the dose response curve, action spectrum and
    mechanism for the production of infrared cataracts. Some scientists believe that the
    damage mechanism is purely thermal, others suggest that there is some evidence that
    it could be photochemical. If the mechanism is photochemical, a strong wavelength
    dependence in the near infrared spectral region will be present, and this will have
    great significance for lamp safety, IR-A medical devices, occupational exposure limits
    and the design of industrial eye protection. With the advent of high-power infrared
    LEDs and diode lasers as well as wavelength-tuneable infrared lasers (e.g. Titanium
    Sapphire laser), it is now possible for the first time to conduct a definitive and
    conclusive laboratory study of the action spectrum for infrared cataract.
    Manufacturers of LEDs, lamps and lasers should be intensely interested in the results
    of such studies. If the aetiology (cause) is purely thermal, the ambient temperature as
    well as the spectral content of the infrared irradiation becomes important and this is
    reviewed in this report. Currently the weight of evidence suggests that the aetiological
    mechanism is thermal.
