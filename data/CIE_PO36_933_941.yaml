abstract:
- content: Due to display market diversification, conventional flat panel displays
    are being developed in curved and flexible. The performance of the display evaluation
    is evaluated not only by the design elements but also by the functional elements
    (luminance uniformity, resolution, contrast ratio and chromaticity). In FPD, typically
    use the point-type 9-point measurement as an international standard. Also in Curved
    display, IEC-TS-62715 proposes a method of optical axis is fixed and divided into
    9- spots to evaluate the luminance and uniformity. A curved display is designed
    to allow the same distance between the viewer and every part of the screen, unlike
    the conventional flat panel display, the distance from the eyes of the viewer
    to the center of the screen is the same with that to the sides of the screen.
    However, the edge of the display is a critical area not only the front surface.
    It is not a good fit to evaluate this area with spot-type device. In this paper,
    we propose a method of evaluating curved display uniformity using each pixel luminance
    value measured by ILMD (image luminance measuring device) which Benchmarked from
    flat panel display evaluation method from DFF (German Flat panel display forum).
