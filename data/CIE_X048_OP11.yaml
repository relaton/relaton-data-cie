abstract:
- content: Gloss is an essential visual property of objects. It is still controversial
    how well gloss constancy works under different light distributions. In this paper,
    we conducted three experiments of different light distributions to investigate
    whether the stable discrimination and gloss constancy of paper occurred with different
    glossiness levels at the different light source distances and illuminances. The
    results suggest instability of paper discrimination and gloss perception when
    both light source distance and illuminance change. Then we tested two additional
    conditions. One is setting the distance the same and manipulating the illumination.
    The other is setting the illuminance constant and manipulating the distance, respectively.
    We further verify that illuminance and specular reflection can affect material
    and gloss perception, regardless of the width of the highlight region changed
    by light source distance.
