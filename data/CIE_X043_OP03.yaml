- content: Using the long-term memory colours of familiar objects as target stimuli
    an extensive set of corresponding colours was derived in a series of memory colour
    matching experiments. Data was collected for five familiar objects with neutral,
    red, yellow, green and blue hues under thirteen illumination conditions. Eight
    of them had chromaticity coordinates on or near the blackbody locus and 5 were
    high chroma illuminations. The data was used to test various versions of a one-step
    and two-step von Kries chromatic adaptation transform (CAT) with CAT02 sensor
    primaries. It was found that the corresponding memory colour data could be predicted
    most accurately by the two-step CAT02 with optimized D. Setting the degree of
    adaptation to one or predicting it based solely on the luminance of the adapting
    field as specified I the CAT02 model resulted in large prediction errors for corresponding
    colour subsets that contained non-neutral adaptive conditions. The effective degree
    of adaptation for the thirteen illumination conditions was modelled using a bivariate
    Gaussian in a Macleod-Boyton like chromaticity diagram. Prediction error for the
    memory colour sets of a CAT02 transform incorporating the Gaussian model was slightly
    worse than with a free D, but was still substantially lower than errors obtained
    for the other models. Finally, a directional chromatic dependence of the degree
    of adaptation was found, with neutral to bluish iiluminants providing better adaptation
    than yellowish, greenish or reddish illuminations.
