abstract:
- content: Textile materials are one of the basic needs of the human life after food
    and shelter. It can be applied in various forms from clothing to high tech applications
    such as protective textiles, medical textiles, geo textiles and sport textiles.
    Consequently, it gives immense inspiration to prepare photochromic textile materials,
    in this regards we take more attention to prepare the mass dyed polypropylene
    filaments with photochromic pigments. Also the commercial spectrophotometer cannot
    measure the whole colour change during the UV exposure without interruption of
    illumination of the samples. To solve this issue it is required to integrating
    the sphere of spectrophotometer, which modifies to add the additional aperture
    for the UV irradiation. In this study, we carried out the kinetic measurement
    of produced photochromic pigment incorporated polypropylene filaments in the LCAM
    developed FOTOCHROM spectrophotometer, and analysed the problems occur in the
    colour strength values (K/S) were analysed with respect to the L,a,b colour space
    and CIE X,Y,Z colour space.
