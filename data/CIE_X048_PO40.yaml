abstract:
- content: Smart lighting systems are based on sensors and tunable lighting systems
    are increasingly more prevalent, but collecting, analysing, and using the large
    data generated by these sensors are challenging. Inspired by research on evolutionary
    algorithms, it can be hypothesized that an adaptive lighting system can operate
    in real-time by adjusting its output through a decision-making algorithm based
    on data mining techniques. Such an adaptive lighting system requires two-order
    input from users; initial and continual. Initial conditions provide training to
    the system through human factors research investigating the interaction between
    humans and their environment. Continual conditions are provided by data collected
    through sensors in real-time, and they continuously feed into the decision-making
    algorithm to adjust the output to meet occupants biological and psychological
    needs. Research indicates that artificial intelligence techniques, such as evolutionary
    algorithms, can emerge as good candidates for this framework.
