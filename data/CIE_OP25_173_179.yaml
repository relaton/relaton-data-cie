abstract:
- content: For implementing the CIE mesopic photometry system to outdoor lighting
    applications, the adaptation luminances needs to be determined to figure out the
    mesopic luminous efficiency function to be used for particular lighting scenarios.
    This study verifies an adaptation luminance simulation method proposed in Uchida
    et al. (2016) by using sets of luminance distributions (LDs) and corresponding
    adaptation luminances measured in a vision experiment by Terai et al. (2017).
    The simulation method was applied to the LDs and the simulated adaptation luminances
    were compared with the empirical data. The result suggests that the simulation
    method can estimate the adaptation luminance when the employed veiling luminance
    model is sufficiently accurate. When a different veiling luminance model is employed,
    the simulation underestimates the adaptation luminance and causes a certain level
    of error on the mesopic luminance. The veiling luminance model contribution to
    the adaptation luminance depends on the LD. For the LDs used in this study, the
    adaptation luminance is considered more sensitive to the veiling luminance model
    than that for real lit scene LDs.
