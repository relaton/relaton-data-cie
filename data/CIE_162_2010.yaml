    The chromatic adaptation transforms used in most colour appearance models
    assume that observers are fully adapted to a given set of viewing conditions.
    Unfortunately, the condition of complete chromatic adaptation usually does not occur
    in the consumer market and in more casual industrial use. Instead, these users tend
    to view softcopy in a room with sufficient ambient illumination to allow comfortable
    viewing and examination of hardcopy imaging. Further, users often desire to
    compare hardcopy and softcopy images using rapid successive binocular
    observations. The focus of this report is to determine how colour imaging experts can
    best accommodate the desires and practices of these more casual observers. It
    shows that accounting for mixed and incomplete chromatic adaptation produces
    more accurate results in colour appearance than not accounting for them. It includes
    a mathematical model for chromatic adaptation and provides appropriate parameters
    for the chromatic adaptation model under such viewing conditions.
    This publication corrects and replaces CIE 162:2004 "Chromatic Adaptation under
    Mixed Illumination Condition when Comparing Softcopy and Hardcopy Images".
    An Erratum is included that shows a corrected version of Equation 6.13 and a
    corrected Annex.
