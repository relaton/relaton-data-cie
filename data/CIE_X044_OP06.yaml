    The International Energy Agency's (IEA) Energy Efficient End-use Equipment (4E) Solid-State Lighting (SSL) Annex is conducting a global interlaboratory comparison for goniophotometers for measuring light-emitting diode (LED) lighting products, called Interlaboratory Comparison 2017 (IC 2017). It is not only a technical study for comparison of various goniophotometric quantities of LED luminaires and lamps, it is designed in compliance with ISO/IEC 17043 to serve as proficiency testing for those laboratories seeking for testing laboratory accreditation for goniophotometers using CIE S 025 (or EN 13032-4) or other regional test methods.
    Participating laboratories will measure a set of four LED product artefacts: (1) a narrow-beam LED directional lamp, (2) an indoor LED panel luminaire, (3) an indoor linear LED batten luminaire, and (4) an LED street lighting luminaire. This paper describes the technical background of the design of IC 2017 and the Technical Protocol including the formula for data analysis.
