abstract:
- content: The road surface and the walls of a tunnel are crucial elements that determine
    the luminance caused by the lighting inside a tunnel. The reflectance of these
    surfaces undergo changes once the tunnel is opened to traffic and as cars are
    driven through the tunnel. Such change in reflectivity depends on tunnel?s structure,
    surface material, and amount of traffic. Considering these changes during the
    designing stage of tunnel lighting to predetermine the appropriate reflectivity
    level, ensures that the design is accurate, while guaranteeing safety for drivers
    as well as economic feasibility of the tunnel lighting. Our research team measured
    reflectance of road surfaces and walls from 99 of 499 tunnels located throughout
    local highways in Korea. These measurements were then analysed with respect to
    the total number of automobiles that had driven through each tunnel since their
    openings, thus enabling us to predict the changes that take place. Further analysis
    were made to determine which value, among those changes, would be most economical
    as far as installation and operation of the tunnel lighting is concerned.
