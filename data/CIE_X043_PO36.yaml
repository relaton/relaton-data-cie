abstract:
- content: Many colour description models have appeared since the old Greeks through
    Davinci and Goethe reaching to the modern colour description models which are
    based on the studies of Newton and Maxwell on light such as the studies of Chevreul,
    and Munsell and others. Finally reaching to the (CIE Lab) and (CIE xyz) colour
    models of the Commission Internationale de l'eclairage. The problem of the current
    study aroused by the study of these systems as these models based only on the
    physical aspects of colours which caused insufficiency in the explanation of many
    colour phenomena such as sparkling and the increase of the visual perception of
    secondary colours on the expense of primary colours and the relationship between
    the violet, red and blue in the visible spectrum. Thus, the aim of this research
    is to develop a three-dimensional colour description model basically depends on
    the spectral response curves of cones in the human eye retina, as it is considered
    the real tool for colour perception. To achieve this, the researchers used the
    descriptive and the experimental analytical methods to study the colour phenomena
    that other colour models failed to explain through three-dimensional colour description
    model that depends on the spectral response curves of cones in human eye retina,
    such as the production of all colour grades that can be recognized by the human
    eye. Moreover, this research has clarified the reasons behind the increasing visual
    perception for some secondary colours on the expense of some primary colours that
    cones sensitive region differs for each primary colour. Additionally, the research
    tried to confirm the independence of violet colour as a separate wavelength. Finally,
    the research attempted to interpret saturation and sparkling phenomena in metallic
    colours through chromatic vision of the rods in the retina. The results confirm
    the hypothesis search and lead to the recommendations to expand on the study of
    the impact of visual perception in colour science and in particular the effect
    of colour constants.
