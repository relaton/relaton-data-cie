abstract:
- content: This article proposes a new metric for roadway lighting design that has
    the potential to improve visibility for drivers during nighttime. The new metric
    is named as Useful Contrast Index (UCI) and it relates the contrast of obstacles
    (targets) to the contrast threshold. We define the useful contrast index as the
    percentage of targets that have a contrast value greater than the contrast threshold
    along the length of the road. We conclude that the Useful Contrast Index has merit
    and could be used to provide a better visual environment for drivers.
