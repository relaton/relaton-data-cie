    In May 2009 the Light and Lighting Conference took place in conjunction with
    the CIE Midterm Meeting. The conference dealt with all aspects of light and
    lighting, with special emphasis on LEDs and Solid State Lighting, covering
    vision and health as well as the measurement of these modern devices and
    their application.

    From the large number of oral and poster presentations in the scientific
    program of the conference 24 papers were selected by CIE experts for this
    CIE publication. These selected papers cover the whole range of the
    conference topics, i.e. latest achievements obtained in light and lighting, their
    consequences in photometry and colorimetry, their health aspects, and
    applications, both indoor and outdoor.
