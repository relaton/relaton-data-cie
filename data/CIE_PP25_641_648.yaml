abstract:
- content: 'Several researches and international standards are focused on the problem
    of quantifying flicker and define how much flicker is acceptable in a given lighting
    situation. However generally only the aspect of the flicker associated to the
    power supply of lighting sources is considered. This research investigates the
    flicker coming from the perceived modulation of light due to the rapid movement
    of an observer under a series of luminaires, like in the case of tunnel lighting,
    where drivers are exposed to regular spatial variation of luminances while they
    go through the tunnel. Two different subjective experiments have been set up:
    one in laboratory for investigating the flicker influences on visual acuity, the
    other one on site for investigating the flicker influences on driver pupil diameter
    when the observer drives through a tunnel.'
