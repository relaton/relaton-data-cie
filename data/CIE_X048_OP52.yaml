abstract:
- content: In outdoor environments after dark, pedestrians may experience discomfort
    from road lighting. Previous studies have therefore developed models to predict
    discomfort from glare in pedestrian applications. However, the performance of
    these models has not been comprehensively assessed, and measurement challenges
    arise in field evaluations. This paper evaluates the performance of a model proposed
    by Bullough et al (2008) and compares it to prediction using only direct illuminance
    at the eye. Diagnostic metric tests were conducted using three independent datasets
    from previously published studies. The results suggested that direct illuminance
    at the eye performed similarly to the Bullough et al. model over the range of
    lighting conditions examined. These conditions included one glare source that
    contributed between 4 lx - 82 lx, and a low contribution from indirect illuminance
    and other lighting installations 1 lx - 4 lx. Further studies are needed to examine
    the importance of incorporating indirect illuminance from source and ambient illuminance
    for predicting discomfort glare.
