abstract:
- content: More and more LED media façades and LED billboards are being installed
    on architecture and buildings in order to decorate city skylines or to deliver
    advertisements. The shopping malls in the busiest streets in city centers make
    extensive use of LEDs to attract tourists and to promote the nighttime economy
    and business. In order to achieve the desired graphic and the display needed,
    these LED media façades and LED billboards utilize RGB LEDs or RBG white LEDs
    and a control system which emits a wide spectrum of light, including blue, green
    and red light. Although each of these colors contributes to skyglow via Rayleigh
    scattering, bluer colors of light are more efficiently scattered, and are of particular
    concern. The shift of the usage of conventional light sources like incandescent
    lamp, low pressure sodium and high pressure sodium light sources to this new type
    of colorful and dynamic LED media façade and billboards has brought new challenges
    to astronomers. This paper describes how the light emission from LED media façades
    and LED billboards increases the artificial skyglow in the atmosphere and more
    importantly how this brightening skyglow affects astronomical observations.
