abstract:
- content: Road surface reflection data in the form of standard r-tables serve as
    input for design calculations of road lighting installations on traffic roads.
    However, in several countries the use of the standard r-tables has not been verified
    by measurement in a long period of time, while the types of road surfaces in use
    have changed - for instance to road surface types with less noise from wheel passages.
    Because of this, a co-operation between the road administrations of the Nordic
    countries (abbreviated NMF) decided to construct a portable instrument to be used
    on selections of traffic roads within these countries in order to provide updated
    knowledge. This article describes the principles behind this instrument.
