    A precise objective definition of low-beam visual cut-off is necessary, since a
    requirement for correct aiming of these beams is specified within all the existing
    regulations.
    At present, aiming of low-beam headlamps is performed visually in Europe and
    USA (since 1997), using the cut-off line in the beam pattern.
    A good definition of a visual cut-off is required to allow uniformity in
    interpretations.
    This report provides a survey of studies into low beam visual cut-off that have
    been carried out in Europe and North America. Based on these studies, a
    recommendation is made for the definition and measurement of the cut-off line of a
    low-beam headlamp by photometric means.

    The publication is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It consists of 19 pages with 6 figures.
