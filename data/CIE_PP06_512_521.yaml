abstract:
- content: TThe correlated colour temperature (CCT) is defined by the closest point
    on the Planckian locus from a light source on the CIE 1960 (u, v) diagram (now
    obsolete), while the current standard uniform colour space is the CIE 1976 (u′,
    v′) diagram. To re-visit the question whether using the (u′, v′) coordinate improves
    the correlation between the CCT values and perception, vision experiments were
    conducted with 12 subjects using a double-booth with non-haploscopic and haploscopic
    methods. The overall results show that the perception of test lights at CCT 3000
    K and Duv -0.015 and 0.015 is closer to the CCT calculated based on CIE 1976 (u′,
    v′) coordinate. The perception of CCT at 5500 K with the same Duv shifts appears
    to be between CCTs based on the (u, v) coordinate and the (u′, v′) coordinate.
    It is suggested that the definition of CCT be re-examined for possibly using the
    CIE 1976 (u′, v′).
