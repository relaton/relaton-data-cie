abstract:
- content: Shading control strategies are nowadays employed in office environments
    to improve the visual comfort of the user. These strategies are often solely illuminance-based
    whereas comfort metrics as the Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) also need luminance
    values. In previous studies, daylight glare has been assessed by calculating the
    DGP from luminance maps obtained via a luminance camera or from a High Dynamic
    Range (HDR) image obtained with a commercially available camera. These detectors
    are traditionally mounted close to the user and aligned with the viewing direction.
    In real office environments, this camera position is impractical, and simulations
    based on machine learning techniques have shown a relation between the DGP from
    an observer's viewpoint and the DGP calculated from a ceiling camera. This paper
    experimentally validates this method in a real office environment by using two
    different cameras and two different illuminance sensors, i.e., a low-cost illuminance
    sensor and a calibrated sensor. Both cameras render similar results, although
    one camera overestimates the DGP. Moreover, the shortcomings of the simulation
    results are pinpointed and the obstacles for a realistic application are addressed.
    Furthermore, it was found that when moving the cameras to different positions,
    the sun position was shown to be an informative additional input for correlating
    the two DGP values. In future work, additional data will be analysed to determine
    the performance in other weather conditions and window orientations.
