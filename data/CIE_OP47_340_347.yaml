    As changes to building design increase the presence of daylight in the office environment, there is an increased need to account for and manage resulting potential visual discomfort. The efficient and accurate prediction of glare is an ongoing process, and the applicability of thresholds for the classification of glare in field settings is still being evaluated. This study assesses the effectiveness of measured and simulated lighting metrics in distinguishing uncomfortable lighting conditions in a sample of long-term open-plan office occupants in a
    subtropical setting. Evaluated metrics both under and over-predicted glare. Implications for further examination of thresholds in field settings and the prediction of glare at the design stage are discussed.
