abstract:
- content: 'The dependence of visual colour quality attributes on the level of object
    oversaturation caused by the illuminant was investigated in a visual experiment
    in the context of museum lighting. A wide range of different spectra generated
    by a multi-LED light engine illuminated a colourful painting at 750 lx with different
    CCTs and different amounts of object over-saturation. Subjects had to assess four
    visual attributes about the appearance of the painting: colour preference, colour
    naturalness, colour vividness and the perceived quality of spatial colour i.e.
    the continuity of colour transitions and colour shadings. To model latter aspect,
    the painting was captured by an imaging colorimeter and its colour transition
    was measured along a line. A possibility for the definition of a so-called colour
    surface rendering index (CSRI) is shown.'
