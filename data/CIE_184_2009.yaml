    The CIE recommended daylight illuminants in 1967. These daylight illuminants
    contained ultraviolet radiation in proportions as found in natural outdoor daylight.
    Indoors this daylight is filtered by the transmission of the window glass; therefore it
    became necessary to define spectral power distributions also for the indoor daylight
    phases. The TC recommends adoption of two indoor daylight illuminants ID50 and
    ID65, that correspond to the phases of daylight of about 5000 K and 6500 K
    The publication is written in English, with a short summary in French and
    German. It consists of 22 pages with 5 figures and 2 tables.
    correlated colour temperature. Tables of the spectra are provided at 5 nm intervals
    from 300 nm to 780 nm, along with the rationale for their development and detailed
    comparison with existing daylight illuminants.
