abstract:
- content: LED wide beam angle lamps have been widely used but might leading to glare
    or light pollution easily than traditional floodlighting lamps. Standards for
    wide beam angle products is not enough and a laboratory experiment was carried
    out in which visual and emotional comfort was used as evaluation items. 3 linear
    lamps (3000K/4000K/5000K) were used to evaluate emotional and visual comfort changes
    by performing different brightness or dynamic speed. Results showed that both
    brightness and dynamic speed could lead to negative feelings while emotional discomfort
    always occurs behind the eyes discomfort. A higher brightness could leading to
    more negative evaluations, while some people think that medium brightness gives
    a more comfort feeling. A faster speed leads to more negative evaluation while
    some subjects prefer a medium speed (both in shading and erasure situations);
    In different lighting scenes, the significance of different indicators is different.
