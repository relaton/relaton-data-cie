abstract:
- content: A non-uniform luminance distribution produces more discomfort glare than
    a uniform one of equal average luminance. Since the average luminance level for
    the standard UGR calculation considers mostly the total luminaire surface, its
    applicability for non-uniform light sources is under discussion. With a growing
    market share of highly non-uniform LED luminaires, a valid discomfort glare metric
    becomes essential. The UGR can elegantly be improved by discriminating between
    background and light emitting part(s) of a luminaire. A luminance threshold identifies
    the high luminance pixels in a luminance map as actual light emitting surface.
    A subjective visual experiment encompassing commercially available recessed office
    luminaires validates the improved UGR method. With a coefficient of determination
    of 0.44, the standard UGR fails to predict discomfort glare. Covering also non-uniform
    light sources, the improved UGR, with a coefficient of determination of up to
    0.80, elegantly ameliorates the visual discomfort calculation from a luminance
    map.
