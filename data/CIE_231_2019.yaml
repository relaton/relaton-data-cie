abstract:
- content: The properties of illuminance meters and luminance meters are characterized
    by a number of selected quality indices defined in ISO/CIE 19476:2014 "Characterization
    of the Performance of Illuminance Meters and Luminance Meters", previously published
    as CIE S 023:2013. CIE 231:2019 summarizes existing national and regional classification
    systems of illuminance meters and luminance meters and recommends a CIE classification
    system. Like existing systems, the proposed CIE classification system is based
    on limit values for the different indices; but differently to all existing systems,
    the uncertainty of the determination of the quality indices is explicitly considered
    in the classification. In the annex some application-related requirements are
    recommended that should be considered where appropriate. The CIE classification
    system attributes a class to each quality index from 4* down to 1*, where 4* is
    the best quality. The lowest class of all quality indices specifies the class
    of the instrument. It is the first internationally agreed classification system
    for photometric measurement devices.
