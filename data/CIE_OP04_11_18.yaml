abstract:
- content: 'This paper laid out two cases of treatment, each carried out with different
    bright light therapy conditions, based on the condition of effective bright light
    therapy for seasonal affective disorder. The purpose of this paper is to assess
    the evidence base for the effect of right light therapy on non-seasonal depression
    and depression oriented people. Bright light therapy used had significant positive
    effect on emotion, leading to significant drop of heart rate and blood pressure.
    We found that physiological parameters and psychological scales were independent
    factors in featuring the improvement of mood disorder. In this study, we obtained
    an optimum bright light therapy condition: LED light at 4400 K of 4000 lx conducted
    in the evening tend to have good effect on non-seasonal depression and depress
    oriented people.'
