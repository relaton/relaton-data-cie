abstract:
- content: "Lack of vehicle conspicuity is a large road safety problem judging both
    from accident statistics in the world, from accident-in-depth studies, and from
    road user explanations of collisions. One way to increase vehicle conspicuity
    also in daytime conditions is to equip the front of the vehicles with lights.
    In this report lights with this purpose are called Daytime Running Lights (DRL).
    Initially the variables that will influence vehicle daytime front conspicuity
    are analyzed. The results of various experimental studies are summarized. It is
    concluded that lights are an effective measure provided they have certain technical
    characteristics concerning intensity, light distribution, colour, number etc.
    Accident statistics from Finland, Sweden, Norway, USA where comparisons of vehicles
    with and without DRL have been carried out support the concept. The reduction
    of the daytime collisions due to DRL is estimated to be in the size of 10 percent.
    The reduction of daytime collisions between cars and unprotected road users is
    even larger. There are also some negative effects of DRL. However, these are judged
    to be of minor importance in comparison with the advantages. \n\nSeveral countries
    have legislation for motorcycles to drive with the low beam turned on also during
    daytime. Some countries have legislation requiring low beam or special DRL for
    all vehicles during daytime (Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark). Canada has corresponding
    legislation for all new vehicles. The Economic Commission for Europe has produced
    a regulation for DRL. USA and some other countries do not require but allow DRL.
    The European Community has lately shown some interest in DRL as a road safety
    measure. However, except for the standard low beam as a DRL, the lighting specifications
    of DRL in most of these legislations, standards and regulations differ from each
    other. \n\nFinally the report analyses what kind of lighting specifications should
    be required of a special DRL, what kind of standard vehicle lights could be accepted
    as DRL, and what special DRL-solutions could be recommended for motorcycles to
    improve vehicle conspicuity in an optimal way. For automobiles the recommendations
    for special DRL are two white lights each with a central intensity of 400-1200
    cd and with a specified light distribution. \n\nThe report contains 20 pages with
    1 figure."
