abstract:
- content: Various empirical tests, calibrations and verifications were performed
    to define the uncertainty contributors for the colorimetric calibrations of surface
    colour standards and emitted colour sources (including colorimeters). A standard
    spectroradiometer was calibrated for luminance and verified for correlated colour
    temperature and CIE 1931 chromaticity coordinates. The spectroradiometer was also
    verified for various surface colours using a set of coloured reference tiles.
    The software of the spectroradiometer, used for calculating chromaticity coordinates
    from the measured spectral radiance, was validated. The contribution of stray
    light to the spectroradiometer measurements was investigated and quantified. Uncertainty
    contributors for emitted colour calibrations, such as uniformity and stability
    of the colour reference screen and distance and viewing angle of the spectroradiometer
    to the screen were measured and calculated for nine colours produced on the screen.
    The various uncertainties for colorimetric calibrations were calculated and will
    be discussed.
