abstract:
- content: In this study, measurements of various domestic light-emitting diode (LED)
    lamps were conducted to investigate the effects of varying illuminance, correlated
    colour temperature (CCT), and colour rendering index (CRI) on visual perception;
    and to determine the users' preference of those parameters under LED lamps in
    Indonesian context. The assessments consisted of subjective performance and preference
    tests. Variation of illuminance, CCT, and CRI of has been found to yield significant
    effect on user performance and preference. On lighting level, variation of both
    illuminance and CCT yields more significant effect compared to CRI. On colour
    appearance, variation of CCT yields more significant effect compared to CRI. Variation
    of CCT also yields more significant effect on colour clarity and visual comfort.
    The subjects preferred higher CRI value for visual comfort, also at illuminance
    350 lx and CCT 6500 K; but preferred higher illuminance and CCT for good lighting
    level and colour clarity.
