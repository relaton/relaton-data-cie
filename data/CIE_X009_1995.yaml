    With the entire world troubled with both the cost of energy and environmental consequences related to energy production, concerns have been expressed regarding energy consumed by lighting. Traditional lighting measures - photometry - as conceived 70 years ago by CIE, are well anchored in illuminatin gengineering practice. They are, however, not adequate to describe all aspects of light sensation. CIE committees are working on additional lighting measures based on global research activities.

    The aim of the symposium was to bring this work into focus and propose future directions for efforts.

    Eight Invited Papers were read, reviewing shortcomings of the present photometric system and describing the most up-to-date research in the field of getting meaningful photometric measurements. The concept of equivalent luminance turned out to be a powerful descriptor of brightness sensation equivalent that could be used also to evaluate other visual phenomena. The symposium participants formulated guidelines for further research and recommended the establishment of a reportership to advise CIE on the most stringent open questions.

    The publication contains 10 Invited Papers and 12 Contributed Papers on over 170 pages.
