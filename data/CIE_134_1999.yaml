- content: "This volume contains short Technical Reports prepared by various Technical
    Committees within CIE Division 6.\n\n134/1 TC 6-26 report: Standardization of
    the Terms UV-A1, UV-A2 and UV-B\n\nThe terms UV-A, UV-B and UV-C were introduced
    in the 1930's by CIE Committee 41 on Ultraviolet Radiation as a short-hand notation
    for photobiological spectral bands. It was never intended that the bands were
    exclusive for different effects. The bands have been in widespread use in different
    medical fields and scientific research. UV-A and UV-B were divided at 315 nm by
    the CIE. In recent decades, some photodermatologists and others have used different
    dividing lines such as 320 nm without recognizing the importance of maintaining
    an international standardized terminology. Because the terminology is used in
    many fields, this report recommends that the 315 nm division between UV-A and
    UV-B be maintained. However, recent research has clearly shown a difference in
    the photobiological interaction of long and short wavelength UV-A radiation with
    DNA. This led to a further division of UV-A into UV-A1 and UV-A2 with a dividing
    line at approximately 340 nm. While this division may be of value, the committee
    does not recommend officially to split UV-A into these two sub-bands at this time.
    Further research may justify a dividing line different from 340 nm in the future.
    \n\n134/2 TC 6-30 report: UV Protection of the Eye\n\nThis report provides a review
    on the current methods for UV dosimetry for the human cornea. The contents include
    a human action spectrum, the dosimeters, the methodology for calibration and the
    calculation of cumulative exposures. Based on the existing data, the levels of
    protection for the UV-A band and the UV-B band are recommended. A set of guidelines
    for ocular protection is proposed to assist medical practitioners in providing
    eye protection for patients. \n\n134/3 TC 6-38 report: Recommendation on Photobiological
    Safety of Lamps. A review of Standards\n\nThere are well known optical radiation
    hazards associated with some lamps and lamp systems. However, serious concerns
    about optical radiation hazards from lamps are rare except with regard to very
    special applications. Aside from solaria and germicidal lamps the lighting community
    has seldom had to be concerned with photobiological hazards of lamps. In most
    general illumination and industrial applications the ultraviolet radiation (UV),
    visible light and infrared energies emitted by artificial sources are not hazardous.
    However, in some unusual situations, potentially hazardous levels are accessible,
    and excessive light and infrared radiation are typically filtered or baffled to
    reduce discomfort. The natural aversion response of the eye to bright light, as
    well as thermal discomfort sensed by the skin normally will limit potentially
    hazardous exposure.\n\nIn some applications, questions have been posed as to whether
    human exposure may be potentially hazardous. For example, heat lamps used for
    treating plastics; the use of some arc lamps in research laboratories; the use
    of very high intensity flash lamps in photography; infrared lamps used in surveillance
    and in heat treating; in some diagnostic medical applications and testing; and
    even in printing and photocopying.\n\nCIE TC 6-38 investigates in the present
    Technical Report the potential photobiological hazards, reviews the world wide
    activity in the field of producing a photobiological lamp safety standard, and
    recommends that the CIE prepare a lamp safety standard using as the basis, the
    North American IESNA standards. The philosophy embodied in those standards have
    addressed the concerns of occupational health and safety professionals and have
    been worked out and tested over a number of years. Most major lamp companies have
    participated in the IESNA development effort, and it is in consonance with ICNIRP
    guidelines. Requirements for lamp types, including labelling would be developed
    by IEC TC/34. \n\n\nThe publication contains also a list of CIE Publications prepared
    within Division 6.\n\nThese reports are written in English, with short summaries
    in French and German. The publication contains 55 pages, with 5 figures and 14
    tables."
