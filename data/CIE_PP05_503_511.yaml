abstract:
- content: The performance of the CIE whiteness formula is focused on D65 illuminant
    and narrow region of colour space correlate not well under other conditions. In
    this study, the new whiteness formula based on CIECAM02 colour appearance model
    is discussed. The perceived whiteness of white textile samples was evaluated under
    three different illumination conditions. Several samples were found to be outside
    the region of validity of the CIE whiteness although they were perceived as acceptably
    white by most observers. The results showed that the new whiteness formula outperform
    other whiteness formulae.
