abstract:
- content: In today's urban environment it is extremely difficult to perform road
    lighting measurements using standard stationary methods. The mobile measurement
    method remains, in fact, the only possible way of assessing the quality of outdoor
    lighting. The presented work is aimed at improving the existing measurement methods
    in terms of quality, speed of measurement and safety of personnel.
