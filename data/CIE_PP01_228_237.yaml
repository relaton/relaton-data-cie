abstract:
- content: We introduced a new daylighting film (DF) and a new optical film-based
    daylighting system (OFDS) using it. In this paper three major points were discussed.
    First, a basic performance of the DF was investigated on ray-trace simulations.
    Secondly, an actual light environment of a room with the OFDS was assessed by
    an experiment. A performance of the OFDS was evaluated by measuring desktop illuminances
    and discomfort glare. And third, a potential of lighting energy reduction was
    analysed by observed illuminances. The obtained data showed that the DF introduced
    sunlight into a room effectively. And the OFDS established an appropriate light
    environment with high desktop illuminance and less discomfort glare. The data
    also indicated the OFDS had a potential of high lighting energy reduction performance.
