abstract:
- content: With the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES) method,
    including a colour fidelity index (Rf) and a colour gamut index (Rg), for evaluating
    the colour rendition properties of light sources, the trade-off relationships
    between colour fidelity and colour gamut were investigated theoretically by optimizing
    the peak wavelengths, spectral widths, and relative intensities of four-channel
    LEDs at the correlated colour temperatures (CCTs) ranging from 2800 to 6500 K.
    The results indicate that the highest scores of Rg at all the selected CCTs indeed
    decrease with the increasing Rf, and that the pattern of the trade-off between
    Rf and Rg is almost independent on the CCT. Furthermore, it is feasible to seek
    out a set of four peak wavelengths for relatively high colour fidelity as well
    as large colour gamut at different CCTs.
