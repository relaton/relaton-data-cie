abstract:
- content: 'Abstract: In order to obtain the quantitative influence law of common
    light sources of museum exhibits on Chinese traditional heavy colour painting
    and the lowest damage light source applicable to different types of painting,
    the paper chose halogen tungsten lamp, metal halide lamp and WLED as experimental
    light source long-term illuminating five kinds of inorganic pigment commonly used
    in Chinese traditional heavy painting: cinnabar, orpiment, azurite, clam powder
    and graphite. Then, the Raman spectra? parameters of samples were measured by
    microscopic Raman spectroscopy before and after illumination of different types
    of light sources. Based on the measured data, the spectra diagram that scattering
    light intensity varies with Raman shift were drawn. Through the analysis of spectra
    diagram, the quantitative influence of three typical light sources on the molecular
    structure of different pigments was obtained. Then the quantitative influence
    law of light sources on Chinese traditional heavy colour painting was obtained.'
