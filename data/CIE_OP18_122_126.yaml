abstract:
- content: This study focused on the neutral white of chromatic adaptation in colour
    science. Using both surface colours and self-luminous colours, an experiment was
    conducted to collected visual results of the neutral white under white illuminants.
    The result proves the previous study about the chromatic adaptation. The baseline
    illuminants of the 2-step CAT was found with different CCTs for the surface colours
    and self-luminous colours respectively. Models of effective degree of chromatic
    adaptation were tested and compared with that found in the previous study, which
    was found highly associated with the viewing media.
