    This Draft International Standard summarizes the most important terms and definitions in the field of lighting by inorganic semiconductors used in CIE documents, which are intended to become part of the International Lighting Vocabulary.

    The Draft International Standard has been sent to CIE National Committees for comments and sales to interested parties. It is still subject to changes and may not yet be referred to as a CIE International Standard. When approved by the CIE NCs, it will be published as a CIE International Standard and later on get part of the International Lighting Vocabulary.
