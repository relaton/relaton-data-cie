abstract:
- content: Colour temperature is one of the most important parameters to control lighting
    according to human activities and required mood. In addition, multi-chip LED packages
    with three or four different colours in a single package are commercially available
    from many LED suppliers. To find control parameters with required lighting characteristics,
    we first optimized CCT by minimizing distance to the target black body locus in
    CIE1931 colour space. Optimization is proceeded in the XYZ coordinate. We applied
    the optimization method to two different colour LED combinations. This optimization
    method provides given target CCT and luminance with high CRI.
