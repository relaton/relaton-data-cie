abstract:
- content: A laboratory study was conducted to determine the physiological mechanism
    for increased discomfort glare caused by increased short wavelength radiance.
    For this, a spectrally free adjustable light source was used as glare source.
    Thus, an specific stimulation of different receptors with, for this purpose specially
    generated, synthetic spectral power distributions was possible. In this study,
    the SWS-cones and rods were determined as potential candidates for the absorption
    of the short wavelength radiance and therefore possibly related to an intensified
    glare sensitivity for increased short wavelength radiance . To transfer the results
    in reality, realistic light sources were shown additionally. The subject?s task
    was to rate discomfort glare on a 9-point-scale. The experiment was run under
    mesopic conditions. The results of the synthetic spectra show no difference for
    the specific stimulation of both receptor-types. The results of the realistic
    light sources indicate that the SWS-cones play a role in the physiological mechanism
    for the studied / mentioned phenomenon.
