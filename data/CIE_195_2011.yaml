abstract:
- content: This Technical Report summarizes the body of work conducted by CIE Technical
    Committee 1-27 "Specification of Colour Appearance for Reflective Media and Self-Luminous
    Display Comparisons" from 1990 until 2001. After compiling data from researchers
    around the world and studying various forms of colour appearance models to predict
    results from hardcopy/softcopy matching experiments under a variety of viewing
    conditions, it was discovered that the same colour appearance model would not
    consistently or adequately predict the visual results. In 2001, all CIE TC1-27
    results were passed along to CIE TC 8-01, Colour Appearance Modeling for Colour
    Management Systems. This Technical Committee within Division 8 formulated an effective
    colour appearance model by combining the best features of the colour appearance
    models that were studied by CIE TC1-27. The result was the development of the
    CIECAM02 colour appearance model.
