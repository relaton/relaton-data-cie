    This Reference Book is based on presentations given by health and safety experts at the CIE/ICNIRP/NIST/USACHPPM Symposium on Measurements of Optical Radiation Hazards, held in Gaithersburg, MD, USA, from 1 to 3 September 1998. It provides an authoritative overview of the science on optical radiation hazards. The articles are written by internationally recognized experts with comprehensive experience in optical radiation research and the assessment of optical radiation hazards.

    The intend of this publication is to provide guidance on how to measure intense light sources (i.e. UV, visible and infrared) and evaluate the potential hazards to the eye or skin. In addition to measurement, calculations are usually required to compare the measured exposure with optical safety limits. This determines the hazard level of the source. This reference book offers a unique source with which to catch up on the latest developments in this important field.

    The objective of this "first-of-its-kind" overview is in many respects tutorial, to promote improved, standardized radiometric measurements of optical radiation hazards from ultraviolet, visible and infrared radiation sources. In addition, the radiometric assessment of protective measures such as sunscreens, clothing and eye protection will also be covered. To achieve this goal, the first few chapters are devoted to a review of the photobiological basis of human exposure guidelines. The second series of chapters are devoted to the human health guidelines and standards (exposure limits), their rationale and any remaining uncertainties. Then, in the third group of chapters, actual measurements and instrumentation are considered.

    This reference book is aimed, but not limited to: industrial hygienists, health physicists, optical physicists, photobiologists, safety engineers, and lighting engineers.

    The volume contains 775 pages, and is softcover-bound.
