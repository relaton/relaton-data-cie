    This report is a revision and update of CIE 115-1995 "Recommendations for the
    Lighting of Roads for Motor and Pedestrian Traffic". Since it was issued in 1995
    power consumption and environmental aspects have become more important and at
    the same time, the improved performance of luminaires and lamps, and especially
    the introduction of electronic control gear, has made it possible to introduce adaptive
    lighting for roads for motorised traffic, conflict areas and areas for pedestrians. A
    structured model has been developed for the selection of the appropriate lighting
    classes (M, C, or P), based on the luminance or illuminance concept, taking into
    account the different parameters relevant for the given visual tasks. Applying for
    example time dependent variables like traffic volume or weather conditions, the
    model offers the possibility to use adaptive lighting systems.
    The publication replaces CIE 115-1995 "Recommendations for the Lighting of Roads
    for Motor and Pedestrian Traffic".
