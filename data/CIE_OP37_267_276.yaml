abstract:
- content: Temperature dependence of LED operation is often not fully considered during
    the design of solid state lighting products. If temperature dependence is not
    carefully considered, solidstate lighting products are typically overdesigned
    to be too robust enough to fulfil the requirements under any possible environmental
    conditions. Temperature dependent nature of LEDs though, could even be a new benefit
    if properly considered. Overdesign means designing for the worst case that is
    the highest possible environmental temperature when LED efficiency/efficacy is
    low. With a control scheme resulting in constant emitted total luminous flux significant
    electrical power saving can be achieved since at lower temperatures, due to increasing
    efficiency/efficacy less electrical power, thus, lower forward current levels
    are sufficient. We present the new, so called iso-flux control scheme and its
    implementation in an actual smart luminaire. The actual control scheme was designed
    with a multi-domain LED model and the results were validated by simulation.
