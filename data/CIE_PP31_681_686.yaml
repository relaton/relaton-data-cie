abstract:
- content: The full scope of present and future LED technology should not be conflated
    with one or more existing LED lighting solutions. Existing LEDs with high Correlated
    Colour Temperatures (CCTs) will clearly have a higher blue component than those
    with low CCTs. As blue coloured light has a lower wavelength and higher energy
    per photon, it is not surprising that high CCTs from any lighting technology would
    be associated with a higher Blue Light Hazard (BLH) weighted dose rate. However,
    it does not follow from the existence of high CCT LEDs that all LEDs are phototoxic.
    This study looks at how appropriate CCT is as an easy-to-communicate substitute
    for hazard ratios, and compares it against other ?correlated? metrics ? based
    on CCT but with the s-cone sensitivity replaced with other short wavelength action
    spectra. The aim is to show that CCT is a much better proxy for BLH-dose rate
    than technology categories.
