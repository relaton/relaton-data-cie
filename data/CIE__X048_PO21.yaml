abstract:
- content: In this contribution a framework is presented that aims to help for handling
    correlations within measurement uncertainty calculations for spectral quantities.
    Taking correlations for spectral quantities into account is necessary as they
    directly influence the measurement uncertainties especially for integral quantities.
    Therefore, determination of correlations within traceability chains at national
    metrology institutes (NMIs) and disseminations of correlated data to test laboratory
    level is encouraged and a major goal of the EMPIR project 19NRM02 Revision and
    extension of standards for test methods for LED lamps, luminaires and modules
    (RevStdLED). The presented python-based analysis framework is used in photometry
    and spectroradiometry at PTB to calculate the results and associated measurement
    uncertainty for spectral irradiance, spectral irradiance responsivity and luminous
    responsivity based on spectral calibrations.
