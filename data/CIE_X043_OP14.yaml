abstract:
- content: Luminous colour used in architectural settings impacts our perception of
    space and ambiance. Colours can be mixed and matched using different spectral
    compositions. We conducted several experiments at architectural scale to explore
    possible differences in visual and visceral qualities produced by stimuli closely
    matched for chromaticity and light level. Study 1 used qualitative research methods.
    The subjects were free to walk from one illuminated space to another to compare
    conditions close-up and from afar. Study 2 used quantitative research methods,
    utilizing a fixed viewing location and a questionnaire that was designed based
    on the responses from Study 1. Most subjects also participated in Study 3, in
    which blood pressure was measured in response to all conditions. The results showed
    that subjects perceived differences in the visual qualities of the conditions.
    The results also showed significant differences between the conditions in affective
    qualities and physiological responses.
