abstract:
- content: Ground-breaking experiments have been conducted over the last few years
    in order to refine the effective and apparent intensity models that are key to
    understanding how flashing visual signals are perceived by mariners. Such refinement
    means that a visual signalling service can potentially be provided in a more efficient
    manner without unduly underestimating its performance. This paper summarises the
    method, results and discussion of three separate experiments conducted recently
    by Research and Radionavigation (R&RNAV) to refine the models used by maritime
    users, authorities and industry. Note that the term 'effective intensity' is only
    valid at the threshold of perception. Whilst the term is also used in the marine
    aids-to-navigation industry, it should be noted that the definitions differ due
    to the higher illuminance threshold at the eye when calculating the luminous range
    of a light for marine use. Therefore, the term 'apparent intensity' is used in
    this paper to quantify supra-threshold conspicuity applicable to marine aids-to-navigation
    usage.
