abstract:
- content: Quantum dots (QDs) can produce a white light with high colour rendering
    while achieving high luminous efficacy, while dual emissive QDs are more applicable
    for spectral optimization of CCT tunable QDs-converted white LEDs (QD-WLEDs) with
    excellent colour rendering. In this study, we conducted a series of combined examinations
    of luminous efficacy of radiation (LER) and colour rendering (CR) of tri-chromatic
    QD-WLEDs by transferring such performance to chromaticity diagram. The approach
    allows an optimization of LER and CRI simultaneously. Numerous tri-chromatic QD-WLEDs
    were simulated. The simulation results show that the optimal CCT tunable QD-WLEDs
    with blue unimodal, red unimodal, and yellow bimodal QDs could realize CRI of
    85-95 LER of 122 lm/W-252 lm/W and CCT of 3145 K-10259 K. Better yet, the combination
    with purple bimodal, green unimodal, and yellowish green unimodal QDs which did
    best at CR, could reach CRI at 97 with LER at 236 lm/W.
