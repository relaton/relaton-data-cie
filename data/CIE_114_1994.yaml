- content: "This volume contains short Technical Reports, Research Notes and Reporters'
    Reports prepared by various Technical Committees and Reporters within Division
    2. In part they were published in the \"CIE Journal\" between 1987 and 1988.\n\n114/1
    Survey of reference materials for testing the performance of spectrophotometers
    and colorimeters\nThis Research Note was originally published in CIE-Journal,
    Vol. 6, No. 1, 23-31, 1987.\n\nA list of reference materials for testing the performance
    of spectrophotometers and colorimeters are given. Particular attention is paid
    to materials for the measurement of regular transmittance and for regular (specular)
    and diffuse reflectance. Materials for the calibration of wavelength scales and
    the measurement of stray light are also included. No examples were found of reference
    materials for the measurement of diffuse transmittance. Information on type of
    materials, suppliers, sizes available and calibration details is supplied.\n\n114/2
    International intercomparison on transmittance measurement\nReport of results
    and conclusions. This Research Note was originally published in CIE-Journal, Vol.
    7, No. 1, 21-28, 1988.\n\nBetween 1978 and 1982, CIE TC 2-09 conducted an international
    intercomparison to assess the accuracy of transmittance measurements. Sixteen
    laboratories, including eleven national standardizing laboratories, took part
    in the intercomparison. Twelve sets of filters were used, each consisting of nine
    glass filters. The filters were selected so that the repeatability, linearity,
    wavelength accuracy, and stray light of the measurements could be characterized.\n\n114/3
    Intercomparison of luminous flux measurements on HPMV lamps\n\nThe results are
    given of an intercomparison of measurements of the luminous flux of a group of
    HPMV lamps, carried out among 21 commercial and national laboratories located
    in 14 different countries. The results reported by 16 of the laboratories lay
    within approx. +/- 1,5% of the mean level and all but two of the laboratories
    were within +/- 3% of the mean level. The consistency of the measurements can
    be regarded as fully adequate for most lighting applications. \n\n114/4 Distribution
    temperature and ratio temperature\n\nThis report adds mathematical precision to
    the definition of distribution temperature and discusses the use and limitations
    of the concept. The concept of ratio temperature as a null method for comparing
    distribution temperatures is also discussed. \n\n114/5 Terminology relating to
    non-selective detectors\n\nDivision 2 Physical Measurement of Light and Radiation
    appointed a Division Reporter (R 2-10) to examine the concepts and terminology
    relating to the description and use of non-selective detectors and to prepare
    a written report making recommendations, if these were felt to be necessary, for
    new definitions, or modifications to existing definitions, to clarify the terminology.
    The present report was submitted to the Division by the Reporter, D.H. Nettleton
    (Great Britain). The members of Division 2 have voted to endorse the conclusions
    of the report and to recommend the adoption and use of the terms and definitions
    proposed.\nThis report was prepared by D.H. Nettleton, Great Britain.\n\n114/6
    Photometry of thermally sensitive lamps\n\nCIE TC 2-12 had the task to develop
    together with IEC/TC 34A recommendations for the photometry of vapour-pressure
    controlled (amalgam) lamps. The committee gave its recommendations directly to
    IEC and these have been incorporated in IEC 81 and IEC 901.\n\nThis report was
    prepared by G. Vandermeersch, Belgium.\n\nThe publication contains also abstracts
    of 19 CIE Publications dealing with photometry and radiometry.\n\nThe Technical
    Collection consists of 45 pages."
