abstract:
- content: In order to provide light sources for endourology and on-site testing of
    the light source, we are developing a portable endoscope light source prototype
    based on a phosphor converted laser diode. A small emitting area from the phosphor
    material excited by a laser diode enables coupling of the generated white light
    into thin optical fibres. The development involves designing optics for optimizing
    the light extraction efficiency and guiding of light to the area of interest.
    In this paper we compared the developed light source to the current standard in
    endoscopy ? xenon arc lamps. Detailed spectral analysis of illuminance, CRI and
    CCT at two power levels and two distances for both the PC-LD and the xenon light
    source was performed. The obtained results verified that the developed light source
    is suitable for endoscopy illumination and the first pre-clinical trials will
    be performed shortly.
