abstract:
- content: Nearly all astronomy at visible wavelengths involves the study of very
    faint objects in the night sky. Astronomy is therefore extremely vulnerable to
    the impact of artificial light, which can produce skyglow, making the night sky
    brighter. Artificial light can travel enormous distances in Earth?s atmosphere,
    limited only by the curvature of the Earth. Astronomical observatories must therefore
    be carefully protected by lighting regulations that extend for distances up to
    300 km from the observatory. Astronomy is particularly vulnerable to blue light,
    which is becoming more common due to widespread use of LEDs. The methods being
    used to protect the major astronomical observatories in Hawaii will be described.
