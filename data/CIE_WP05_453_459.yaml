abstract:
- content: Four perception experiments are reported, in which a typical office environment
    was simulated, and the acceptability of the stroboscopic effect was measured,
    expressed as the percentage of people annoyed with the effect as a function of
    Stroboscopic effect Visibility Measure value. A limit of SVM = 1.5 is proposed.
    Based on the results, a functional relationship is provided, which can be used
    as a first proposal for the stroboscopic effect acceptability in different applications.
