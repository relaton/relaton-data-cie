abstract:
- content: The appearance of object surface could be largely influenced by lighting
    conditions and object materials, but it has not been systematically analysed.
    We examined how the colour appearance of object surface was influenced by the
    diffuseness of lighting in real miniature rooms. We used two miniature rooms illuminated
    by a diffused light and a direct light, respectively. We presented a test sample
    with sine-wave surface which depths were 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm and 0 mm. Both glossy
    and matte surface materials with five colours were prepared for the samples. Observers
    judged the colour appearance of colour samples by selecting their corresponding
    colours. The results of corresponding colour for test samples were similar under
    both diffused and direct lighting conditions. These results suggest that the colour
    appearance of samples that we tested was quite stable among the change in material
    and illumination.
