abstract:
- content: Increase of chroma is known to be a major factor for colour quality preference
    in lighting, and gamut area measures are often used to evaluate preference aspects.
    However, gamut area accounts for chroma differences equally for all hue directions.
    Experiences in lighting indicates that red is most dominant in such colour quality
    preference but experimental data has not been available. Vision experiments were
    conducted to evaluate different effects of chroma shifts in different hue directions
    on colour quality preference, using NIST Spectrally Tunable Lighting Facility
    simulating an interior room. 19 subjects viewed various fruits, vegetables, and
    their skin tones, under illumination of 11 different spectra of different gamut
    shapes. The 11 spectra were presented as pairs in all combinations, at correlated
    colour temperatures (CCT) of 2700 K, 3500 K, 5000 K, (Duv= 0) and 3500 K (Duv=
    -0.015). The average results show that chroma increases of red ('C*ab ≈ 5 to 15)
    has the largest effect, green ('C*ab ≈ 15) has the second effect, and yellow's
    effect is insignificant, in subjects' preference. The results will be useful to
    develop colour preference metrics that correlates well with perceived colour quality.
