abstract:
- content: The results of the previous experiments were further analysed. IES-TM-30
    fidelity metric and local chroma shift of red hue bin were proved to be efficient
    to predict naturalness and colourfulness of lightings, respectively. A modified
    Gaussian model with these two metrics was built to predict the lighting preference
    as the last part of jigsaw of total colour quality of lighting. Independent datasets
    including preference or attractiveness assessment of lightings was used to test
    the model.
