abstract:
- content: 'Light is fundamental in architectural design: spaces and objects perception
    is strictly influenced by luminous scenarios. This is especially true as regards
    museums applications. In these cases, lighting is essential to assure the complete
    perception of colours and shapes of artworks, guaranteeing visual comfort conditions.
    A reproduction of museum installation was set in the Laboratory of Photometry
    and Lighting at the Department of Industrial Engineering of University of Study
    of Naples "Federico II" and a reproduction printed on canvas of "Te aa no AREOIS"
    was lit by four light scenes. Then tests on subjects were carried out, in order
    to investigate human preferences about artworks lighting; results are reported
    in this paper.'
