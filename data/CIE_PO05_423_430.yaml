abstract:
- content: The evaluation components for lighting quality include visual comfort,
    visibility, user-required affective factors, workability etc. that are different
    up to the architectural use of space and behaviour types of users. All of these
    components contribute to overall user satisfaction. Our affective factors are
    composed of stimuli through five senses (sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste),
    behaviour types, and individual long-term experiences. We therefore need to understand
    the deviation between user-required `affective factors' formed from long-term
    experiences and `those' influenced by visual pathway against the illumination
    change. The current study attempts to figure out this deviation and to determine
    the affective factors significant for human-centric illumination development,
    particularly in office space.
