    Two recent studies Dikel et al [2014] and Ohno and Fein [2016] found light sources with chromaticities below the blackbody locus were preferred. Wei and Houser [2016], however, found the preferred light settings in these two studies may be due to the colour rendition rather than chromaticities. This study aimed to investigate how chromaticity alone affects preference. Twenty-three observers evaluated pairs of light settings at 3000 and 6500K. The light settings with same CCT had different chromaticities but similar colour rendition, in terms of colour fidelity, relative gamut area, and gamut shape. Among the 3000K light settings,
    those with Duv of -0.02 and -0.03 were the most preferred; among the 6500K settings, those with Duv of 0 and -0.01 were the most preferred.
