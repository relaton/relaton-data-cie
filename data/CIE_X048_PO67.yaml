abstract:
- content: Twenty-four hours light exposure of employees in three different occupations
    was assessed for a working week during both summer and winter. Occupations being
    exposed to light at night and those exposed to low daytime light levels were represented
    by night shift working geriatric nurses and daytime working hotel staff, respectively.
    Their light exposure was compared to the light exposure of outdoor workers represented
    by refuse collectors. In winter, luminous exposure of night shift working geriatric
    nurses and daytime working hotel staff amounts to only 2 % and 12 % of the luminous
    exposure of outdoor workers, respectively. In summer, the respective values are
    6 % and 21 %. This could lead to a desynchronization of circadian physiological
    processes in the human body.
