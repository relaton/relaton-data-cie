abstract:
- content: Pulse-width modulation is a widely used technique to control the power
    and intensity of solid state lighting systems but under specific conditions it
    can cause undesirable flicker or stroboscopic effects. Two studies were conducted
    to analyze these effects. In the first study, standard pulse-width modulation
    was used. The influence of the modulation frequency and duty cycle was considered.
    The proposed approach was applied in the second study. The results show the ability
    to reduce the stroboscopic effects even at low frequencies of pulse-width modulation.
