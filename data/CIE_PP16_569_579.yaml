abstract:
- content: The European project Delphi4LED (launched within the framework of the EU?s
    H2020 ECSEL program in 2016) is aimed at the development of new LED compact models
    that can improve the design LED based lighting products at all integration levels
    along the SSL supply chain. The compact thermal models of LED packages and the
    multi-domain models of the LED chips are foreseen to be identified from measured
    LED characteristics. When setting the targeted accuracy levels of these models
    one needs to be aware how accurately and with what uncertainty the required LED
    characteristics can be measured by the application of the latest available LED
    testing standards. Therefore, the Delphi4LED consortium decided to start an inter-laboratory
    comparison of measurements of five different representative LED types. The methodology
    complies the most recent LED thermal testing standards and the new CIE test methods
    for optical measurements of high power LEDs. As such it is the first occasion
    to embrace these concepts at international level and should pave the way for broader
    use.
