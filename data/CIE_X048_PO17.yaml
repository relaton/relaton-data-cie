abstract:
- content: The method for estimating the illuminance distribution in the vertical
    plane of museum objects (paintings) using a digital imaging luminance meters (ILMD)
    is considered. In order to pass from the luminance distribution to the illuminance
    distribution, a screen with reflective properties close to diffuse (Lambert) reflection
    is used. The theoretical and experimental uncertainty estimation of the measurement
    method done.
