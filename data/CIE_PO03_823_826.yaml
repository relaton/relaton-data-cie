abstract:
- content: This study aims at finding which combinations of the light colour and the
    type of make-up are preferred on the appearance of woman's facial skin. We conducted
    an experiment on the appearance of woman's face with four types of make-up 'Natural',
    'Cute', 'Elegant' and 'Cool', under some lighting conditions. Forty digital images
    of female face with make-up under a variety of lighting conditions were evaluated
    in terms of 'naturalness,' 'activity', 'sophistication' and 'preference'. In conclusion,
    the face with 'Natural' make-up (in orange colour) looks good under 5000K in positive
    duv. On the other hand, the face with 'Cool' (in beige colour) make-up looks better
    under 4000K. Therefore, the preferred light colour depends on the type of make-up.
