abstract:
- content: Variety models of glare indices have been set up or are being studied by
    CIE. However, the lacking of guidance or standards in the aspect of the physical
    measurement hinders the wide application and comparison of the glare indices.
    At present, ILMD is internationally recognized as a good solution for glare measurement,
    but the performance of the ILMDs varies very much, which leads to difference results
    in glare evaluation. The paper investigates different types of ILMD and further
    uses the numerical simulation to study the sensitivity coefficients of the factors
    to the measurement uncertainty of glare indices, and the requirements of an ILMD
    can therefore be proposed properly so as to acquire acceptable accuracy of glare
    indices.
