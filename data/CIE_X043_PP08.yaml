abstract:
- content: Light-emitting-diode lighting can be used for spectral control. With this
    technology, it is possible to change the illuminance and colour temperature of
    the lit environment in real time. However, the comfortable range of the illuminance
    zone is influenced not only by the illuminance and colour temperature, but also
    by the thermal environment. In this study, steady state experiments are conducted
    examining the changes in the "hot-cold", "warm-cool", and "comfortable-uncomfortable"
    perceptions of experimental subjects corresponding to the hue-heat effect, which
    are based on the colour temperature. Variations are particularly observed for
    tests conducted in changeable transition periods such as Autumn and Spring.
