abstract:
- content: Optimising lighting installations reduces energy consumption and stray
    light while providing optimal visibility conditions for road users. However, the
    origin of the large discrepancies often observed between the design of lighting
    installations and their actual performance remains poorly explained. For the design
    stage, it is assumed that the road has homogeneous photometric characteristics.
    To examine the impact of pavement heterogeneity on these differences, numerous
    measurements of pavement reflection properties were carried out on an experimental
    site with a portable device. A homemade software was used to perform several road
    lighting calculations by integrating the measured r-tables in different ways.
    New metrics based on lighting performance criteria deviation and pavement reflection
    properties deviation are used to compare the calculations. The results highlight
    the importance of measuring the optical properties of pavements and confirm methodological
    guidelines for making representative on-site measurements.
