abstract:
- content: The paper presents a pilot study conducted as part of an ongoing multidisciplinary
    research project entitled Swedish Research Project on Perceptual Metrics for Lighting
    Design. The overall objective is to develop definitions and concepts for light
    quality, as well as a basis for methods and tools for evaluation and design of
    light environments based on visual and emotional experience of light. The purpose
    of the study is to investigate how a selection descriptive words is associated
    with various light qualities in the room. The study also compare perceived contrast
    and brightness to the photoreceptors response to logarithmic light intensity,
    using the ELF measurement (Environmental Light Field).
