abstract:
- content: "This Standard specifies a method to consistently assess the photometric
    performance of vehicle headlighting systems to enable the performance of different
    systems to be compared. The requirements are given in relation to road scene illumination
    and the limitation of glare, and the performance is assessed using parameters
    relevant to lane guidance and the detection of pedestrians and objects. \n\nThe
    Standard includes a measurement and calculation procedure. It does not specify
    the format of an assessment report."
