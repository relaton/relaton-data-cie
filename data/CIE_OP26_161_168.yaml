abstract:
- content: 'In the CAT02 chromatic adaptation transform, adopted in the CIECAM02 colour
    appearance model, the degree of adaptation D is only related to the luminance
    of the surrounding field. Research has already shown that the chromaticity of
    the adapting illumination has a significant impact on D. In this pilot study,
    the impact of adapting field size on the D factor was investigated for three field
    sizes: 0Â° (no adapting field), 20o and 80o. A memory colour matching approach
    was used to obtain corresponding colours under 13 different surround illumination
    chromaticities by making a grey cube appear achromatic. The results showed that
    chromatic adaptation for the largest surrounding field is more complete than for
    the smaller surrounding fields.'
