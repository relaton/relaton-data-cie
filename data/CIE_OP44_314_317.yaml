abstract:
- content: LED is generally used as the source of indoor lighting; however, the physiological
    effect of different blue-light wavelengths on humans is a primary issue. The physiological
    effect of working environments with different white-light LED lighting on humans
    is therefore proposed in this study to find out the indoor lighting for keeping
    high work efficiency and reducing visual fatigue. The experimental lighting conditions
    contain 2 colour temperatures (400K/6000K), 2 illuminations (400 lux/700 lux),
    and 3 dominant wavelengths of blue light (420nm/460nm/480nm). Reading and tasks
    are executed in the experimental process, in which the participants? brainwave,
    heart rate variability, blinking rate, and critical flicker fusion threshold are
    fully measured. The results show little influence on visual fatigue under the
    white-light LED source with low colour temperature and 460nm blue-light wavelength.
    Nevertheless, the LED source with high illumination, high colour temperature,
    and 420nm blue-light wavelength presents better effects on the promotion of concentration.
