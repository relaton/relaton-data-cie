abstract:
- content: This research used LED lighting in a real room to test the theory of "colour
    emotion" in a lit environment. The experimental results show that observers tended
    to prefer white lights having negative Duv and high CCT (5000K and 6500K) at the
    same luminance level (300 cd/m2). Blue and green lights tended to make the facial
    skin feel old, rough and masculine, while red and purple lights tended to make
    it feel smooth and feminine. These findings indicate that colour emotion for interior
    lighting has a systematic tendency when examined by CCT, Duv, hue region and purity.
    This will help develop guidelines for interior lighting design based on either
    white lights or coloured lights.
