abstract:
- content: This work investigates three kinds of surface treatments of displays under
    ambient lighting conditions. For all treatments of the experiment, the luminous
    distributions of displays are measured by an Imaging Luminance Measuring Device
    (ILMD). To evaluate the reflected glare on displays, the joint effects of display
    polarity and illumination condition were designed in the experiments. Total of
    12 reflected glare conditions were measured, three kinds of displays, two types
    of display polarity contents and two ambient illumination levels. This paper reviewed
    the popular glare metrics and conducted an experiment to present the applicability
    of those metrics for predicting glare on electronic displays in indoor environments.
