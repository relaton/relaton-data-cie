abstract:
- content: A measure to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus during the first
    year of the pandemic was to stay home. Thus, working and learning activities have
    migrated to dwellings under the so-called home office scheme. In this context,
    exploring the lighting conditions in home offices from the occupants perspective
    is vital for understanding the quality of the perceived visual environment at
    home. Based on data collected in Brazil and Colombia, this preliminary study aimed
    to investigate occupants perception of the luminous environment in home offices
    and the influence of regional and personal characteristics. This study is part
    of broader research related to Subtask A of IEA Task 61, Integrated Solutions
    for Daylighting and Electric Lighting. Occupant's subjective assessments were
    collected from December 2020 to March 2021 through an online survey with professionals
    working from home. The results show that most professionals have an entire room
    for the home office, and these are more satisfied with the visual environment.
    In general, higher satisfaction was achieved when the lighting level was perceived
    as brighter and strong reflections were associated with disturbing glare situations.
    Most of the occupants perceived the light and colours as neutral. Daylight is
    more appreciated than artificial light. Participants located between 20°S and
    34°S latitude were less satisfied with the visual environment in the home office.
    The first approach is part of comprehensive research, generating new data about
    lighting in home offices to subside guidelines for improving housing projects.
