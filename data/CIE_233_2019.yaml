abstract:
- content: Array spectroradiometers are used pervasively in light measurement. However,
    their properties are not widely understood by users. CIE 233:2019 seeks to educate
    users in the characteristics of array spectroradiometers that are important to
    obtaining accurate measurement results. Moreover, performance indices are proposed
    that will enable users to rank instruments according to the properties that affect
    their applications. In many cases, if the array spectroradiometer is properly
    characterized, correction can be made to measurements that will improve the accuracy.
    Details of the nature and use of these corrections are given. Calibration procedures
    and uncertainties are discussed for various common quantities, giving a sound
    foundation to measurements. Background information, underlying the discussions,
    is found in the annexes and references.
