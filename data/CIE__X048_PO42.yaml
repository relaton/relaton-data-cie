abstract:
- content: Human centric lighting (HCL) is the sum of visual and non-visual effects
    of light on humans. According to the results of the research carried out to date
    it is explained that lighting design results for cell office should reach EML
    (Equivalent Melanopic Lux) higher than 250 and CS (Circadian Stimulus) approximately
    0.4-0.3 at office hours 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM. This study is an alternative lighting
    design were created in which EML and CS criteria values are specified in cell
    office without receiving daylight. Artificial electrical lighting design should
    be analysed in order to deliver an optimal circadian lighting that can help to
    increase occupants productivity, performance and decreasing energy consumption.
