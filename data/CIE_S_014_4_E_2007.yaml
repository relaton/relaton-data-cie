    The three-dimensional colour space produced by plotting CIE tristimulus values
    (X,Y,Z) in rectangular coordinates is not visually uniform, nor is the (x,y,Y) space nor
    the two-dimensional CIE (x,y) chromaticity diagram. Equal distances in these spaces
    do not represent equally perceptible differences between colour stimuli. For this
    reason, in 1976, the CIE introduced and recommended two new spaces (known as
    CIELAB and CIELUV) whose coordinates are non-linear functions of X, Y and Z. The
    recommendation was put forward in an attempt to unify the then very diverse practice
    in uniform colour spaces and associated colour difference formulae. Both these
    more-nearly uniform colour spaces have become well accepted and widely used.
    Numerical values representing approximately the magnitude of colour differences
    can be described by simple Euclidean distances in the spaces or by more
    sophisticated formulae that improve the correlation with the perceived size of
    differences.

    The purpose of this CIE Standard is to define procedures for calculating the
    coordinates of the CIE 1976 L*a*b* (CIELAB) colour space and the Euclidean colour
    difference values based on these coordinates. The standard does not cover more
    sophisticated colour difference formulae based on CIELAB, such as the CMC
    formula, the CIE94 formula, the DIN99 formula, and the CIEDE2000 formula nor
    does it cover the alternative uniform colour space, CIELUV.
