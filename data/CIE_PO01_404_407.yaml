abstract:
- content: 'This study evaluates the visual influences of indoor reading illumination
    in relation to two operating factors: the correlated colour temperature and task
    illuminance. Psychophysical experiments are carried out to explore the impact
    of these two factors on visual comfort, visual fatigue and task performance. An
    illumination control model based on the subjective perceptions is established
    to define the satisfactory operating range.'
