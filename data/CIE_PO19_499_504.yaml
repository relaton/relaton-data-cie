abstract:
- content: The colour volume represents the reproducible colour of the display, which
    is to evaluate the display performance. This colour volume is to calculate the
    measured colours in three dimensions using the uniform colour space. In this study,
    we evaluate how the colour volume calculated by LAB visually matches. The evaluation
    evaluates and compares the QaMbM of CIECAM02 and the IcTcP. The visual experiment
    is carried out by expressing the colour volume as the richness of the colour.
    Also, the experiment uses the image with adjusted colour gamut, white luminance
    and black luminance. Experimental results show that the method of measuring colour
    gamut volume using CIECAB L*a*b* does not match the visual evaluation. However,
    the colour gamut volume calculated using QaMbM and IcTcP can very well predict
    visual data.
