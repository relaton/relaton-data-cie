abstract:
- content: For visibility, many studies have been conducted on visibility with uniform
    luminance background. However, when applying the results to the real world, since
    the visual object or the background normally have complicated brightness distribution,
    the application is difficult. This study examines through an experiment on sighted
    persons (including those whose visual acuity have been corrected) and persons
    with low vision (not including those whose visual acuity have been corrected)
    using an evaluation method involving a brightness contrast image which can examine
    quantitatively under complicated brightness distribution environment on the assumption
    of visibility of signs and obstacles.
