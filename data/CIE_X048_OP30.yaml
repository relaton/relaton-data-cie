abstract:
- content: This paper presents a novel method for studying threshold levels for positive
    phototaxis of insects and smaller mobile organisms. Outdoor lighting affects light
    sensitive species and there is a need to evaluate the effect of light levels,
    spectral composition of the light and light distribution to mitigate the ecological
    impacts of the artificial light. For this purpose, a test box investigating the
    effect of light on insects in a controlled manner has been constructed. The box
    is equipped with a luminance source and the light levels can be varied from a
    maximum value continuously down to zero. The spectral composition of the light
    can be varied by changing the lamp or using optical filters. For visibility of
    the insects the box has infrared light emitting diodes in the ceiling and two
    wide-angle cameras monitor the light response. The functionality of the box is
    tested with the species greater wax moth.
