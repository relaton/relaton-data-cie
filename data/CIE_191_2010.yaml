    This report deals with visual task performance based approaches to mesopic
    photometry, with a major aim to establish appropriate mesopic spectral sensitivity
    functions to serve as the foundation of a system of mesopic photometry. A review of
    the most important visual tasks and the range of visual conditions typically
    encountered in the context of night-time driving is given.
    The existing visual performance based systems for mesopic photometry were
    reviewed and tested with new independent data sources. The outcome of the
    analysis and testing is a recommended system for mesopic photometry based on
    visual performance. The report summarises the justifications for the recommended
    system and gives general guidelines for its use and application.
    The publication is written in English, with a short summary in French and German.
