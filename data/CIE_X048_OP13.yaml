abstract:
- content: LED-based lighting products are the fastest developing light sources on
    the general lighting market. These include not only white light sources, but also
    coloured light sources. SI-traceable calibrations with a low measurement uncertainty
    are challenging because their unique spectral and geometric properties must be
    taken into account. The requirements on the measuring equipment and resulting
    uncertainty contributions differ significantly from those for the calibration
    of conventional incandescent or fluorescent light sources. Furthermore, different
    detector types can be used when calibrating LEDs. These include classic photometers,
    radiometers, spectroradiometers but also imaging systems such as ILMDs. Each of
    these measuring devices has its specific advantages and disadvantages.In this
    paper, traceable calibrations on 9 coloured and 9 white LEDs are discussed. Various
    array spectroradiometers, photometers, radiometers and a double monochromator
    were used for this purpose. Each of these measuring instruments is discussed in
    terms of its suitability for measuring different physical quantities (e.g. array
    spectrometer for measuring illuminance).
