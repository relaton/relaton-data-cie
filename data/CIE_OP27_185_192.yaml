    A pilot study on tsunami evacuees guiding method with lighting system was carried out in a coastal area, the Fukura district of Minami Awaji City, where is anticipated heavy damage by Tsunami at Nankai Trough Earthquake. The study was conducted through community tsunami evacuation drills at the area. In the results, differences in evacuation behavior between residents and assumed tourists were found. Most of the resident participants (90%) were aware of illuminated route signs, and only 17% participants of assumed tourists noticed them. As the sense of safety, many participants who noticed the signs felt a psychological sense of
    safety. It means that the noticeability is very important to not only find the correct escape routes but also to be reassuring. It is necessary to improve the specifications of these illuminated signs for effective guidance system of Tsunami evacuation.
