abstract:
- content: In the last years, as a result of environmental concerns, changes in lifestyle
    during the COVID-19 crisis, the role of healthy buildings in addition to the main
    lighting design principles are highlighted. Therefore, todays lighting design
    issues include social well-being, mental well-being, and physical well-being more
    than we discussed in the last century. Hence, we are familiar with occupant-centric
    and performance-based metrics for residential and non-domestic buildings. The
    study analyses the extended occupancy patterns, daylight availability, and annual
    lighting energy demand through a case study in Bursa, Turkey including the COVID-19
    pandemic scenario.
