abstract:
- content: As a first step to induce Asian cities to come up with measures to assess
    and prevent light pollution, light trespass generated due to street lightings
    in urban residential areas was investigated, and in order to resolve the problem,
    existing methods had been adapted while new methods were devised. Residential
    areas in Asian cities, especially those areas that had been developed long time
    ago, have very narrow streets. The distances between luminaires and property lines
    are very close, and because residential buildings are located on both sides of
    the street, both the forward and backward light from luminaires are sources of
    light trespass. In installing street lightings for an urban residential area in
    Asia, the new evaluation method on light trespass is one of the data of a luminaire
    that would enable prevention of light trespass in advance. Codes indicating both
    the forward and rearward distances free of light trespass is assigned. Together
    with other factors that either cause light trespass or affect lighting performance,
    installation height and distance between luminaires, these codes can be used as
    the rating standard for street luminaires.
