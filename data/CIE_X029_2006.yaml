    In 2001 CIE has organized its first symposium on the evaluation of uncertainty in
    measurements. This follow-up conference held at the Physikalisch-Technische
    Bundesanstalt (PTB) Braunschweig, Germany summarized the latest results and
    trends in this topic, particularly the evaluation of uncertainties associated to values of
    photometric and radiometric quantities and developments related to methods for the
    assessment of uncertainties of quantities which are derived from spectral
    measurements.

    The symposium was split into two main parts: tutorial and workshop. The
    tutorial covered fundamentals for uncertainty evaluation, modelling of measurements
    i.e. modules and measurement equations, combinations of modules, uncertainties of
    calculated quantities resulting from spectral measurements, uncertainty calculations
    in key comparisons and measurement uncertainty evaluation based on the
    propagation of distributions using Monte-Carlo simulation. The 1993 ISO publication
    "Guide to the expression of uncertainties in measurement" (GUM) is devoted to
    mainly linear models, the advantage of the Monte-Carlo method is that non-linear
    models and models with more than one output quantity can be handled. A separate
    lecture introduced the work of CIE TC 2-43 Determination of measurement
    uncertainties in photometry.

    A great part of the contributed papers dealt with the analysis of spectral
    measurements. Ways to determine the correlation between the different spectral
    responsivities together with the calculation of the photometric responsivity were
    presented. The linear model and the Monte-Carlo simulation was compared and the
    additional possibilities, like the determination of the correlation matrix, of the Monte-
    Carlo simulation was analysed. Two papers addressed the question of the
    uncertainty of the average LED intensity. Further papers were read on industrial
    applications, scale realization, monochromator bandwidth correction, etc.
