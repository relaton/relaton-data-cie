abstract:
- content: High chromatic colours are used largely in various industrial sectors (e.g.
    textiles, emergency)   in last years. Aim of research was observation of influence
    of decreasing luminance level on assessment of respondents and verification of
    adaptation mechanisms in mesopic and photopic level human vision. The perception
    and discrimination of colour affect many aspects. These aspects are illumination,
    mental and physiological condition of the observer, viewing conditions, position
    of samples, work place and also transmission of light through of human eye, photoreceptors
    (rods and cones) and processing the nervous system. According different of luminance
    level we can talk about photopic, mesopic and scotopic vision. Change of the spectral
    sensitivity of the human eye at the change of luminance levels is named as the
    Purkinje shift. When change of luminance level is shifted the maximum luminous
    efficiency to the shorter wavelengths. Therefore the evaluation was carried in
    the viewing box with fitted a daylight simulator D65. For achieving different
    luminance levels are used plates. On one side of plates were applied the tint
    foil with light transmittance 16% or 6%. For evaluation of a group of observers
    were selected high chromatic colours of blue from CIELAB colour space. All samples
    were measured on the spectrophotometer. The samples had with distance dE=1 to
    dE=5 from central sample. Results of the experiment were evaluated with using
    formulas for evaluation of colour differences - CIELAB, CIE2000 and CIECAM02,
    COQ, PF/3 factor and STRESS index. From the evaluation of the observers were obtained
    visually perceived colour differences. The dependence visually perceived colour
    difference and calculated colour difference were contained the dependence visually
    perceived colour difference on the luminance level. Finally, the results were
    compared with the results of the MOVE and LRC laboratories.
