abstract:
- content: People's desire for more pleasant living conditions has grown even more
    in recent years in Asia. However, along with sharp increase in use of night-time
    lighting equipment due to growth in economically active population and changes
    in people's lifestyles, the ill effects from light pollution have also increased.
    Countries around the world have come to recognize light pollution as a social
    problem and have been implementing their own regulation measures based on international
    guidelines such as CIE 150 and IDA/IES MLO. Since the enactment of "Light Pollution
    by Artificial Lighting Prevention Act" in 2012, numerous fact-finding studies,
    researches, and environmental assessments had been and are being carried out on
    a national level in Korea. In this study, through application of light pollution
    standards to current state of light pollution caused by advertisement lightings,
    we analysed the problems associated with light pollution's characteristics, and
    proposed improvement measures.
