abstract:
- content: Reducing waste from luminaire and light source products has become a core
    priority for practice and research. This has to do with luminaires frequently
    ending up in landfills and that scarce rare earth elements are seldomly recovered.
    This paper explores how the use of modern information systems, like Building Information
    Modelling (BIM), in conjunction with databases, can contribute to increasing the
    recycling rates of light sources and luminaires. Although there is a wealth of
    studies on BIM and life-cycle assessments (LCA), there is a scarcity of studies
    exploring the interface of BIM, LCA and lighting. Based on a review of the literature
    and interviews with subject matter experts, this paper contributes an early understanding
    how relevant environmental data about luminaires can be systematically stored
    and transmitted throughout the life cycle of a project. Findings indicate that
    the latest generation of BIM classification structures allows for manufacturers
    and material suppliers to make their product data readily available for construction
    design teams. Making this data available in a structured digital way, allows for
    informed environmental decision-making throughout the life cycle of a building
    project aiding recycling rates and material recovery.
