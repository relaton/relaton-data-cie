abstract:
- content: Amongst many road lighting design criteria, energy performance plays an
    important role as it has a direct link to operational costs, potential reduction
    of carbon dioxide emissions, mitigation of obtrusive light, and its impact on
    the night-time environment in urban and con-urban settlements. The energy energy
    performance of road lighting is conveniently described by the pair of normative
    numerical indicators PDI and AECI established in European standards. This paper
    aims to present typical values of the AECI (Annual Energy Consumption Indicator)
    for different combinations of road arrangements, road widths, lighting classes
    and light source technologies to illustrate what benchmarks can be expected using
    this assessment system. Essential part of this paper is focusing on assessment
    of the performance for traffic intensity and traffic detection based lighting
    adaptation.
