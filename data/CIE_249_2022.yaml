abstract:
- content: The fast rate at which solid-state light sources can change their luminous
    output is one of the main drivers behind the revolution in the lighting industry
    and applications of lighting. The fast rate of the intensity change means that
    a modulation of the luminous output, both intended and unintended, is directly
    linked to the modulation of the driving current. In turn, the light modulation
    can give rise to distortions in the perception of the environment.
