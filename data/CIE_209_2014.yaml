abstract:
- content: The field of atmospheric ultraviolet radiation (UV) research is plagued
    with difficulties in nomenclature. The problems arise from (a) the strong wavelength
    dependence of UV radiation received at the Earth's surface, (b) the ad-hoc way
    disparate groups have approached the subject and (c) the incorrect use of units
    when action spectra for different UV effects are incorporated. This report highlights
    some of the issues, taking vitamin-D synthesis, a beneficial effect, as a specific
    example. Standard vitamin-D dose (SDD) and minimum vitamin-D dose (MDD) are proposed,
    analogous to the standard erythema dose (SED) and minimum erythema dose (MED)
    that are in common use for erythema. In recognition of the fact that currently
    accepted action spectra may be revised in future if new data become available,
    it is recommended that spectrally resolved irradiance measurements are maintained
    and continued so that biologically effective irradiances and doses may be reprocessed.
