abstract:
- content: The requirements for a measurement device regarding the detection of temporal
    light artefacts are complex in many ways. In this work, we investigated the effect
    of aliasing and its impact on SVM and Pst. For a suitable measurement device,
    an anti-aliasing filter is essential, but the right choice of such a filter involves
    the consideration of many factors. Very important is the correct adjustment of
    the sampling frequency with respect to the transmission of the anti-aliasing filter.
    Filter type, filter order and cut-off frequency in combination with the chosen
    sampling frequency are directly related to measurement errors. In addition, not
    only the measurement itself, but also the calculation of quantities like SVM and
    Pst can introduce errors to TLA results. For the evaluation of SVM for instance,
    a Fourier transformation of the signal is necessary. To avoid or minimize errors
    in the frequency detection, common signal processing techniques can be applied.
    We examine the use of zero-padding (nulling) and windowing on the input signal
    before an FFT is performed. With the right choice of these techniques, we increase
    the reliability of the results. These techniques cannot be applied directly to
    the evaluation of Pst, since this calculation is done in the time domain. Nevertheless,
    we show that advantages in terms of reliability and measurement duration can be
    achieved by moving to the frequency domain (Fourier transformation).
