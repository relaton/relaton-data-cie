    This study introduces human centric implementation scenario for office smart lights
    considering ethnic differences between Korean and Caucasian. This solution includes the
    optimal CCT and illuminance ranges in which the user-required affective and visual elements
    are fulfilled in accordance with action types in three subdivided office spaces of general office,
    conference room and lounge. The mathematical functions are also proposed to estimate
    preference degree for both Korean and Caucasian. Some interesting results are found in the
    culture deviation study: the gap of UGR (Unified Glare Index) value and the viewpoint
    difference about important lighting-quality factors leading to different optimal CCT and
    illuminance ranges.
