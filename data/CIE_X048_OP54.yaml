abstract:
- content: Road safety is determined by the distribution of luminance created by asphalt
    concrete surfaces. On the one hand, experimental determination of the bidirectional
    reflectance distribution function is laborious, on the other hand, for some angles
    this task is difficult. The authors propose to use both analytical and statistical
    models of the luminance factor, which allow determining the luminance factors
    or coefficients for arbitrary angles of incidence and sighting. The models are
    based on the idea of a plane-parallel layer, in the volume of which radiation
    scattering occurs. With correctly selected optical properties of the layer (the
    optical thickness of the medium, the albedo of single scattering, the phase function
    of the particles included in the composition), the models allow obtaining reliable
    results, which was confirmed when compared with the measurement results. The models
    can also be applicable not only for asphalt concrete pavements, but also for any
    other surfaces.
