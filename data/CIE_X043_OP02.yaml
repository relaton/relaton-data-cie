abstract:
- content: Magnitude estimation experiments were performed to investigate the brightness
    perception of related self-luminous stimuli. Twenty two observers assessed the
    brightness of 30 coloured self-luminous stimuli presented on a 28 cd/m² self-luminous
    background. All stimuli had the same luminance level of 50 cd/m2. The brightness
    scaling show a clear and prominent Helmholtz-Kohlrausch effect (in which saturation
    changes affect brightness changes), The brightness ratings for these 30 positive
    contrast self-luminous stimuli were found to be well predicted (R² = 0,743, ρ
    = 0,862 and ρs = 0,897) by CAM15u, a model recently developed to predict the colour
    appearance of unrelated stimuli.
