abstract:
- content: A suitable light environment is the basis for human activities. With the
    development of times and the progress of science, people are more and more dependent
    on artificial light sources. In the past, many applications of metamerism phenomenon
    have been used in the identification of anti-counterfeiting. However, this phenomenon
    can be better applied in lighting to improve the visibility of objects. A group
    of light sources of metamerism has a large or small difference in colour rendering
    effect of the determined unsaturated colour, which leads to differences in identification
    effect. After the use of colour R1 to R8 as the colour sample, a group of metamerism
    light sources as light source, we found that a large chromatic aberration could
    be produced when a determined colour sample illuminated by a group of metamerism
    light sources. This phenomenon may be more obvious if the colour samples of lower
    saturation are used. If  the most favourable light source for target identification
    was selected in the actual scene, the object would be more easily visible.
