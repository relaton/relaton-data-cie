abstract:
- content: The appearance of an object depends on its material, shape, and lighting.
    In particular, the diffuseness of the illumination has a significant effect on
    the appearance of material and surface texture. We investigated a diffuseness
    condition suitable for reproducing surface appearance using computer graphics.
    First, observers memorized the appearance and impression of objects by viewing
    pre-observation images rendered using various environment maps. Then they evaluated
    the appearance of the objects in test images rendered under different levels of
    diffuseness. As a result, moderate diffuseness conditions received a higher evaluation
    than low diffuseness conditions. This means that low or very high diffuseness
    unfamiliar in daily life is unsuitable for reproducing a faithful and ideal surface
    appearance. However, a particular material is difficult to memorize and evaluate
    its appearance. The results suggest that it is possible to define a diffuseness
    that adequately reproduces the appearance of an object using computer graphics.
