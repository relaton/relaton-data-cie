- content: In our study chromatic discrimination thresholds of normal colour observers
    measured with the Trivector test of the Cambridge Colour Test were analysed. Chromaticity
    coordinates were transformed from the CIE (1976) uv diagram to the CAM02-UCS and
    CAM16-UCS colour spaces, where colour differences were calculated.The measured
    data consisted of chromatic discrimination thresholds measured in 66 reference
    points covering the gamut of a CRT display. The test directions were set to the
    confusion axes towards the Protan, Deutan and Tritan confusion points.Our results
    show variance in the AE values expressed both in the CAM02-UCS and CAM16-UCS colour
    spaces.Since our input chromaticity values described previously measured just-noticeable
    stimuli - therefore perceptually equal colour differences - we assumed that our
    data show equal colour differences in the uniform colour spaces. However, the
    discrimination thresholds transformed to CAM02-UCS and CAM16-UCS show that colour
    differences increase towards the chromaticity of the adapting light.
