abstract:
- content: This document describes the elements, function and characterization of
    imaging luminance measuring devices (ILMDs). Furthermore, the calibration of ILMDs
    is described and some guidelines for their use are provided.Using ILMDs the projection
    of the luminance distribution of a scene can be recorded and made available for
    further evaluation. In addition to a simple documentation of measurements, the
    geometrical assignment of the image points into the object coordinate system often
    allows more complex calculations by combining luminance, directional and, if necessary,
    solid angle information (e.g. for glare evaluation). In addition to the flexible
    evaluation option, it is possible to acquire a large number of measured values
    quickly and, if necessary, even synchronously. Furthermore, the type of evaluation
    can also be coupled to the image content, i.e. the image areas to be evaluated
    can be determined in the image either by their position within the image or by
    their luminance value.
