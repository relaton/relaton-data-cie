abstract:
- content: The study used a small experimental room and two types of lighting, accent
    and ambient, where a 3D polyhedron object was displayed to serve as a visual task.
    The observers assessed the 3D object in terms of "sense of depth" and "liking",
    followed by assessment of the entire room in terms of "brightness" and "comfort".
    Experimental results show that the darker the ambient lighting was, the more likely
    it was that the 3D object felt rich in sense of depth, and that the 3D object
    was liked. The results also show that for non-Taiwanese observers, reducing perceived
    brightness of room tended to enhance liking of the 3D object, but such a tendency
    was not found for Taiwanese observers.
