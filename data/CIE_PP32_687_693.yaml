abstract:
- content: Effects of mood states on evaluation of light environment evaluation were
    inspected in this study. Light conditions were set in two levels, light (2200
    lux) and dark?340 lux). Light level was changed from light to dark or dark to
    light in an experiment and effects of change order were also considered. Mood
    states were calculated by Profile of Mood States score which was developed for
    clinical use. Subjects were classified into high and low mood states by limits
    of 25, 50 and 75 percentile values of mood score. As a results, tension?anxiety
    mood was related to the evaluation of glare and comfort. Vigour mood was related
    to the brightness, comfort, preference and performance. Anger-hostility mood was
    related to the glare and performance. Depression mood was related to the brightness
    and glare. However, fatigue and confusion mood were not related to the evaluation
    of light environment at all.
