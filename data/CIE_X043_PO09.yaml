abstract:
- content: For indoor lighting, the established measure for discomfort glare is the
    Unified Glare Rating (UGR), which assumes that the source area may be characterized
    by the average luminance. With the introduction of LEDs in general lighting, many
    new luminaire types have become available, some of which with a highly non-uniform
    luminance distribution. 60 papers were reviewed, of which the majority is from
    a more recent date (2012-2016). Many studies show that for the same average luminance,
    there is a significant difference in discomfort glare experience between uniform
    and non-uniform luminaires, and subsequently imply that UGR is not always a reliable
    glare measure of these highly non-uniform luminaires, characterized by high luminance
    contrasts and high local peak luminance in the exit windows. In this paper, all
    proposed alternatives to predict discomfort glare are discussed, with a focus
    on proposals that are easy to implement as limited modifications of the UGR.
