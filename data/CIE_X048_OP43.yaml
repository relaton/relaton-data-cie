abstract:
- content: We have developed a new calibration capability for 200 nm to 400 nm ultraviolet
    light-emitting diodes (UV LEDs) using a Type D gonio-spectroradiometer. The recently-introduced
    mean differential continuous pulse (M-DCP) method is used to overcome the measurement
    difficulty associated with the initial forward voltage, VF, anomaly of a UV LED,
    which makes it impossible to use VF to infer junction temperature, TJ, during
    pulsed operation. The new measurement facility was validated indirectly by comparing
    the measured total luminous flux of a white LED with that measured using the NISTs
    2.5 m absolute integrating sphere. The expanded calibration uncertainty for the
    total radiant flux is approximately 2 % to 3 % (k = 2) depending the wavelength
    of the UV LED.
