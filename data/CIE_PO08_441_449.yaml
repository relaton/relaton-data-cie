abstract:
- content: New type of dynamic dot matrix LED advertising signs have the characteristics
    of high brightness, fast response, high colour saturation, with flicker and diverse
    contents, which get the attention of human eyes but also easy to cause glare and
    flicker hazards. In this research there are two kinds of dynamic dot matrix LED
    advertising signs, which commonly used by current domestic business, including
    peacock-tail lights, octagon-shape lights. Three peacock-tail lights, and three
    octagon-shape lights were studied and located in Taipei City and Hsinchu City,
    respectively. Through the statistical analysis of monitoring data (luminance,
    vertical illuminance, horizontal illuminance), we get the appropriate photometric
    measurement parameters for glare and flicker evaluation. In summary, flicker evaluation
    criteria and luminance measurement method of outdoor LED dot matrix dynamic advertising
    signs will describe in this paper, which might be a good reference for light pollution
    control.
