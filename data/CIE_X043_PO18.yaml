abstract:
- content: The evaluation of whiteness of a product is dependent from the materials
    and the application it is used in. Natural materials for example tend to yield
    some yellowish tint e.g. cotton or wool, so the industry modifies the materials
    to compensate for this effect (yellowish tint of a product is most often seen
    as a quality flaw, e.g. yellowed due to aging or dirt) and make the appearance
    of a product whiter. The intuitive interpretation of paper whiteness is a material
    with high light reflection for all wavelengths in the visual part of the colour
    spectrum. However, a slightly bluish shade is perceived as being whiter than a
    neutral white. Fluorescent Whitening Agents (FWA), dyes and pigmented inks are
    used extensively in the textile, pulp and paper industry. It was found that in
    some cases, calculated CIE whiteness values increased with increasing amount of
    colours in the whitened substrate appeared darker or redder to the observers.
    Small deviations in measured CIE tristimulus functions X, Y, and Z often caused
    significant changes in calculated CIE, and Ganz whiteness values. A visual assessment
    study of the selected samples was carried out in order to relate the influence
    of the high tint to perceive white. The results show the deficiencies in the current
    measurement techniques for assessment of brightness and whiteness of textile fabrics
    containing optical brightening agents.
