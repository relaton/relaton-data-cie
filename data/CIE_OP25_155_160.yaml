abstract:
- content: This thesis aims at exploring the effect of structural material on discomfort
    glare evaluation in locomotive cabs, summarizes the common structural material
    including chromaticity coordinate, reflectance and refractive index as a reference.
    Firstly, an integrated optical simulation in consideration of lamps, displays
    and indicator lights was conducted to emulate and quantify glare indicators using
    various different materials. And then the ergonomics experiments were conducted
    to verify the relationship between discomfort glare and the reflectance and refractive
    index of materials by comparison with the subjective visual feeling and visual
    search performance under different samples. Experiment results showed that:1)
    discomfort glare in the dark cab can be improved by adjusting the reflectance
    and refractive index of materials inside, including direct glare and veiling reflection
    on the windshield and visual display terminal(VDT).2) The brightness of veiling
    reflection on the windshield and VDT can be lower than the existing typical structural
    material and visual performance significantly improves(P<0.05).3) With the structural
    material of 35 %, DBR value was the optimal, in specific reflectivity range, WP
    value in direct proportion to the structural material.
