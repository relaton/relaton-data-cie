abstract:
- content: Currently, the typical models of China's existing wide-body aircraft include
    the Boeing b777- 300ER, A330-300, and Boeing787-9, with varied degrees of differences
    in the light environment in each model. In this paper, investigations on the influencing
    factors of cabin internal comfortability have been carried out based on the abovementioned
    three types of cabin lighting configurations for wide-body airliners. The task
    performed during the investigation is to measure indicators, such as cabin illuminance,
    luminance, colour temperature, colour rendering properties, etc. Through comparisons
    and analysis on three models of aircraft based on obtained statistics, the thesis
    illustrates and affirms merits of Boeing787-9 in terms of lighting environment
    conditions. Meanwhile, defects of lighting environment of China's existing wide-body
    aircraft still exists. The thesis will make out series suggestions on measures
    to upgrade lighting environment conditions of existing wide-body airliners to
    achieve its goals of providing a more comfortable light environment for passengers.
