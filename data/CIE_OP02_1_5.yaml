    has increased the number of sleepless people who are influenced the physical and
    mental conditions because of inadequate rest time. A lot of people therefore seek
    for medication; however, it would cause bad side effects. It is expected to propose
    a method with less stimulation but being able to help people fall asleep faster,
    have sufficient sleep, and effective improve the quality of life. To enhance the
    quality of sleep, a dynamic lighting system which could assist people in fast
    falling asleep is proposed in this study. The dynamic lighting source would periodically
    change the colour with time. According to the experimental results, the use of
    dynamic lighting could more easily have the participants fall asleep.
