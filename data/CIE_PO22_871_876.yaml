abstract:
- content: 'This project is based on a garden proposal for Les Jardins de Metis in
    Grand-Metis, Quebec, Canada. The garden borrows its idea from Josef Albers'' Interaction
    of Color and serves as framework to experience perception and sensation, colour
    and light. The objective of this study is to demonstrate: The Interaction of Color
    is valuable architecturally and aesthetically and in terms of performance. The
    effect of colour can be increased without changing people''s perceptions of the
    colour in the space, by applying the interaction of colour with the larger built
    environment in nature or within larger fields. This project is part of a larger
    research on Colour reflectivity and Daylight. Colour reflectivity is valuable
    not only architecturally and aesthetically but also in terms of performance. The
    higher the  reflectivity of a space the more evenly light is distributed in the
    space. Reflectivity can improve the performance of a building''s system and also
    increases the occupants'' sense of well-being.'
