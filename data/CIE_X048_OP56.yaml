abstract:
- content: Light absorbed by sensitive artwork may cause irreversible damage. Optimising
    the spectral power distribution of light sources to minimise absorbed light can
    reduce damage while maintaining the colour appearance of artwork. Previous absorption
    minimisation studies used optimisation methods without comparing their performance.
    Here, three channel RGB LED projector spectra was optimised for 24 colour samples
    by using brute-force (BF) and a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA). BF search
    and MOGA were similar in achieving optimal results, reducing both light absorption
    and energy consumption by almost half. MOGA was 2.5 times faster than BF in finding
    optimal solutions. The results indicate that an LED RGB projector can be used
    to illuminate museum artifacts to reduce light absorption and energy consumption,
    with the caveat of perceptible colour shifts in certain samples. Future research
    will investigate the use of CIECAM02 instead of CIEDE2000 and observers subjective
    evaluations of artwork under optimised lighting.
