abstract:
- content: By using artificial lighting for the investigation of medical research
    hypotheses there are new challenges for the evaluation of the data and the results
    obtained. Within this paper the effect of light exposure is quantified by electroencephalography
    (EEG) Data, heart rate, blood samples, pupillometry data and self-rated sleepiness.
    This Data has been collected in two studies funded within the German BMBF NiviL
    Project. The results and methods of the second study as well as the newly developed
    light exposure unit with pupillary exposure control feedback will be presented
    here. Pupillometry data is evaluated using the Pupillen Unruhe Index (PUI). Heart
    rate and heart rate variability (HRV) are analysed and melatonin concentration
    of the blood samples is shown. Since there is no agreed standard of EEG data evaluation,
    one approach on spectral analysis of the data is presented and remarks on using
    EEG to characterise the influence of light is given.
