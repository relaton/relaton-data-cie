abstract:
- content: It has been shown that with aging, cataracts become cloudy and colour perception
    and visual acuity deteriorate. As the world's population ages, there is a need
    for signage that considers older people's visual characteristics. This study aimed
    to clarify the effects of sign components on visual perception and identify differences
    in the effects of age. We conducted a psychological evaluation using the semantic
    differential method on 20 young and 10 elderly. The results showed that the younger
    participants gave higher ratings to many questions than the older participants.
    The factor analysis results showed that the items of the questionnaire consisted
    of a "visibility factor" and "harmony factor". The elderly were more likely to
    be affected by the viewing distance than the young invisibility.
