abstract:
- content: It has been pointed out that LED sometimes causes unnatural colour appearance
    due to the chromaticity distance from the Planckian locus (Duv). In this study,
    subjective experiment was conducted to identify the effects of Duv of LED luminaire
    on the lighting environment considering the interior surface material. From the
    results of the experiment, it was identified that brightness evaluation was significantly
    different when the chromaticity coordinates was off the Planckian locus even when
    the correlated colour temperature of the light source was classified as the same
    by JIS. It was also shown that the effects of Duv on brightness evaluation differ
    depending on the combination of interior material and which side the Duv shifts.
