    In March 2016 the Lighting Quality & Energy Efficiency Conference took place in Melbourne, Australia. The event gave academics, lighting industry professionals, designers, researchers and representatives of regulatory authorities the opportunity to discuss best practice and the latest developments in the field of light and illumination. The conference focused not just on quality lighting and energy-efficient light sources, but also on colour and visual perception, non-visual effects of lighting, testing and measurement, and other aspects of lighting technology and lighting application.

    The Proceedings of this Conference include invited papers and papers of the oral and poster presentations.

    The publication consists of 769 pages including 100 contributions.
