abstract:
- content: This paper presents the transmittance haze (TH) results of high haze materials
    measured according to current documentary standards, such as ASTM D1003 and ISO14782,
    and some other measurement methods, such as double-beam method, double-compensation
    method and BTDF. Compared to the TH by double-compensation method (theoretically
    accurate TH), the TH ratios of all methods were very close to 1 except for those
    of ASTM D1003. The ratios of ASTM D1003 became close to 1 after the sphere multiplier
    correction. From the TH data, the differences among various methods at high haze
    level are similar to those at the haze value below 40 % and it means that the
    structure of an integrating sphere also affect the measurement at highlevel haze
    mainly.
