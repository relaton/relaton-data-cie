abstract:
- content: This paper presents a set of field measurements performed at renovated
    lighting installations equipped with adaptive road lighting systems. The results
    revealed issues of over-illumination but also insufficient lighting levels that
    would not be shown without the field measurements. Since the adaptive road lighting
    systems can regulate the lighting output and should in parallel ensure adequate
    lighting and safety levels, the commissioning of such system is challenging. In
    this scope, we are proposing a holistic scheme for the commissioning and optimization
    of the operation of Adaptive Road Lighting systems taking into account field measurements,
    technical parameters of the incorporated equipment, and all aspects that may affect
    its performance. The proposed scheme can be used as a masterplan from the conception
    of the road lighting up to the validation field measurements and the long-term
    optimization and maintenance schedule of the installation.
