abstract:
- content: 'Our aim was to find out how CIE standard illuminant L would decrease the
    measurement uncertainty of field luminance and illuminance measurements. With
    help of data of 10 different photometers and 75 spectral power distributions of
    light sources a large number of spectral mismatch correction factors (SMCFs) were
    calculated and analysed. Based on preliminary results 10 different light sources
    were selected as possible calibration sources. 75 light sources were divided into
    6 groups: halogen lamps, white LEDs, fluorescent lamps, HID lamps, monochromatic
    LEDs and natural light sources and for each group most suitable calibration source
    was found together with overall best calibration source which gives SMCFs closest
    to value 1 for all photometers and light sources. Results show that white LED
    with CCT close to 4000 K is the best suitable calibration source and its use would
    in average decrease the measurement uncertainty by up to 2 %.'
