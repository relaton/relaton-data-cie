abstract:
- content: Parametric design is widely used in architectural design, mainly in appearance
    design, and the lack of performance optimization and data introduction. Introducing
    the parametric design concept into lighting design. On the one hand, it achieves
    the purpose of beautiful appearance by combining with architecture, and on the
    other hand, it establishes the one-toone correspondence between lighting parameters
    and graphics software and realizes the control of lighting parameters on the graphical
    interface. Visualize lighting options on the graphical interface. And optimize
    lighting design.
