    A circadian lighting regime was formulated based on the action spectrum of the circadian and photopic lights. Using LED panels, the regime was implemented, tested and evaluated in classroom environment. The circadian to photopic ratio C/P was identified as one of the key parameters along with standard photometric and spectrometric quantities. The circadian rhythm of the human body as decomposed into time intervals of the day. By the continuous monitoring of the light output from the LED panels, we obtained instantaneous values and variation in the parameters, such as luminous flux, correlated colour temperatures, colour
    rendering indices, luminous efficiency and CS value. Based on these measurement data, we derived the variation of colour temperature versus that of black body radiation and that of the colour coordinates of the sun light. we also calculated the circadian stimulus curve and found it consistent with the one suggested by Mark Rea et al.
