abstract:
- content: This study aims to evaluate users' attention levels under different lighting
    environments by measuring and analysing brainwaves. The acquired brainwave signals
    are processed by Hilbert-Huang transform to find the marginal spectra of intrinsic
    mode functions for computing the corresponding powers in the alpha and beta bands.
    The receiver operating characteristic analysis is then utilized to suggest candidates
    of attention index based on the classification accuracy of binary discrimination
    tasks.
