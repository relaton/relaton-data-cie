abstract:
- content: This research used LED lighting in a real room to test the theory of "colour
    emotion" in a lit environment. The experimental results show that observers tended
    to prefer white lights having negative Duv and high CCT (5000 K and 6500 K) at
    the same luminance level (300 cd/m2). Blue and green lights tended to make the
    facial skin feel old, rough and masculine, while red and purple lights tended
    to make it feel smooth and feminine. These findings indicate that colour emotion
    for interior lighting has a systematic tendency when examined by CCT, Duv, hue
    region and purity. This will help develop guidelines for interior lighting design
    based on either white lights or coloured lights.
