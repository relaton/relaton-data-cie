abstract:
- content: 'A recent study investigated the influence of lighting on crime by considering
    the effect of change in ambient light level on crimes recorded in three US cities
    for the ten-year period 2010 to 2019. The results suggested a significant increase
    in robbery after dark, but did not suggest significant change in for any other
    type of crime. The current study was conducted to validate this by considering
    crimes recorded in three different US cities. This analysis confirmed the statistically
    significant increase in robbery after dark. These data do not suggest that change
    in ambient light level has a practically relevant effect on overall crime counts:
    in other words, the potential benefit of lighting for crime reduction is limited.'
