    This technical report provides general requirements for the photometry of lamps and luminaires of most types and includes the following information:

        * standard test conditions under which the tests should be carried out, with acceptable practical tolerances;
        * selection procedures for lamps and luminaires;
        * procedures for measurement of the photometric characteristics of lamps and luminaires and assessment of the possible sources of error;
        * correction factors and service conversion factors;
    * presentation of test results.

    The report is considered to be sufficiently comprehensive to form a practical guide for industrial laboratories and contains sufficient information to replace publication CIE 24-1973 Photometry of indoor type luminaires and CIE 27-1973 Photometry of luminaires for street lighting.

    CIE will publish supplementary reports covering these types of luminaires more specifically.

    This Technical Report is written in English with a short summary in French and German. It contains 53 pages, with 5 figures and 3 tables.
