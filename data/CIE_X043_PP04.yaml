abstract:
- content: In this work, one efficient measuring scheme is proposed for the measurement
    of angle-resolved luminance with imaging sensors. Mainly, a Lambertian diffuser
    transmitting screen is introduced to highly reduce the measuring time. In addition
    to the light sources, the measuring scheme can be also easily expanded for the
    measurement on the BRDF and the BTDF of the diffuse surface materials. Finally,
    some testing examples are also presented in our experiments.
