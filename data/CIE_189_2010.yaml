    Experience of making road tunnel lighting designs in accordance with publication
    CIE 88:2004 has shown that there are some aspects of calculation of the different
    lighting criteria where more specific guidance to the designers is necessary. This
    document explains how the tunnel environment differs significantly from the open
    road situation. In particular, the presence of walls along the traffic road involves
    reflection effects between different surfaces. The variation of luminance level along
    the tunnel, the changes in the lighting installation along the entrance section of the
    tunnel and the use of different lighting systems in different parts of the tunnel
    introduce more complexity in the lighting calculations. The report gives guidance on
    determining the method for calculating the relevant lighting quality criteria for tunnel
    situations.
    The publication is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It
    consists of 18 pages with 4 figures
