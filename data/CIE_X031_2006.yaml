    7-8 September 2006, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada

    The first CIE Expert Symposium in this Series, entitled "Light and Health" was held in
    Vienna, Austria, 29 September - 1 October 2004, and its emphasis was centred on
    the results of unfolding research on the effects of light upon the neuro-endocrine
    system, most notably the identification of a novel photoreceptor in the human retina
    and its role in regulating circadian rhythms, and ultraviolet radiation effects upon the
    skin and eyes. The discussions during that symposium led to the conclusion, that a
    follow-up symposium should be organized with the emphasis upon practical
    implications for lighting from new research findings.

    This second symposium on Lighting and Health was thus organized in conjuction
    with Division 3. It was held in Ottawa, 7-8 September 2006, and provided updates on
    scientific progress, with a stronger emphasis on how we might apply this new
    information in lighting recommendations and lighting design. The sessions were
    organized in two parts 1) fundamentals where the biological basics were presented,
    and 2) application papers detailing the practical implications and practices that might
    result. About one-third of the time was devoted to discussion of the possible
    consequences for different lighting scenarios, lamp and luminaire specifications.

    The symposium had four presented paper sessions and a poster session. The
    session on Fundamentals reviewed photoreception, the neural pathways that
    regulated circadian rhythms and experiments to phase shift the circadian cycle. The
    related application papers discussed measurement issues and the different effects of
    application with different light sources. The session Effects upon Healthy People
    concentrated on fatigue, stress and reduced alertness after long periods spent
    indoors under artificial lighting. Extra stress, sleep disorders and cancer risk of shift
    workers, further jet-lag of travellers were debated and lighting conditions were
    presented to reduce these negative effects. Medical and Clinical Lighting Therapy
    focused on well adapted lighting conditions especially for the elderly to treat sleeping
    disorders by supplying carefully prescribed light exposures. Lighting therapy devices
    and new concepts of luminaires were demonstrated. Finally, a panel-led discussion,
    Applications in Lighting, centred on discussions on applying the circadian and health
    research findings for applied lighting. The discussions were triggered by a featured
    speaker in each session. Implications for day- and night lighting and future road
    maps for CIE Divisions 3 and 6 were discussed. The Poster Session covered very
    diverse topics from gerontopsychiatric care of aged people that showed improvement
    for higher lighting to effective UV radiance and irradiance measurements, and the
    interrelation between in vivo and in vitro action spectrum for vitamin D production.
    More than 160 people from 21 countries attended the symposium showing an
    increase of around 60% compared to the first symposium in Vienna, indicating an
    increasing interest in Lighting and Health.

    The papers included in this volume are edited by the authors; they are
    published in full under the responsibility of the authors themselves. The editing group
    restricted its contribution to matters of typography and layout.
    The Proceedings contains the full text of all the presented 24 papers and 29
    posters.

    The publication consists of 239 pages with 164 figures and 13 tables.

    A CD-ROM with all papers in a searchable form is included with the puchase of the "softcover/CD-ROM" format.
