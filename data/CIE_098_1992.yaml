    Natural and artificial ultraviolet radiation (UVR) can induce both beneficial and detrimental effects in man. Humans are exposed not only to natural UVR, but also may be exposed either intentionally or unintentionally to artificial UVR sources (tanning equipments, workplaces, etc.).

    Normally people do not maintain a fixed position with respect to the UVR source, and so measurements using a stationary detector can be of limited value.

    Consequently the exposure dose of radiation can best be determined by means of personal monitoring.

    A practicable personal dosimeter for UVR is a polysulphone film, which after exposure to ultraviolet radiation in the spectral range 250 to 330 nm, shows an increase in absorbance at 330 nm. In evaluating actinic radiant exposure, the action spectrum of the photobiological effect under consideration, the spectral power distribution of the UVR source and the spectral response of the personal dosimeter have to be known.

    Detailed information on the practical use of polysulphone film is given, together with a description of other UV-sensitive materials that may be suitable for personal UVR dosimetry.

    The report contains 21 pages, with 4 figures and 63 bibliographic references.
