abstract:
- content: Most colour appearance models (CAMs) have been developed to predict the
    colour appearance only for related colours in different viewing conditions. More
    recently, CAMs to predict for unrelated colours have been proposed due to the
    availability of the experimental data. This paper investigates the performance
    of the three promising colour appearance models for unrelated colours, i.e. CAM15u,
    CAMFu and CAM20u using an experimental dataset carefully accumulated by Fu et
    al. in term of CV values. The results showed that the latest CAM20u outperformed
    the other models. CAMFu, as the oldest model, whose performance was much worse
    than other two models in predicting brightness and colourfulness, and performed
    well in predicting hue composition, while CAM15u gave a moderate performance in
    predicting brightness and colourfulness, but performed slightest worse than the
    others for hue composition.
