abstract:
- content: The purpose of this study is to examine the importance of red when colour
    rendition of object colours is evaluated, also check the accuracy of "Colour Quality
    Index" called Gx(E) proposed by the authors which takes account of illuminance
    and gamut shape. Two psychophysical experiments were conducted using various light
    sources with different gamut shapes and illuminances. The observers evaluated
    the colour and texture impression of the colour samples (the paint and the fabrics)
    by the SD method. It was confirmed that the colour rendition of red was important
    not only for colour impression but also for texture impression. In addition, Gx(E)
    showed good correlation with subjective evaluation regardless of illuminance.
