abstract:
- content: Hospitals are complex environments having to balance out contradictory
    requirements from patients and health workers. Despite evidence demonstrating
    the critical role of the hospitals luminous environment in responding to occupants
    requirements and needs, and the importance of engaging with the patient experience
    to improve the quality of patient care, to date, no studies have articulated approaches
    to study conflicting occupants needs for lighting in context. This paper presents
    a semi-systematic literature review of disciplinary approaches to investigate
    quality lighting conditions in hospitals and subjective impressions of occupants.
    Research articles from the clinical, built environment, and lighting fields were
    selected and evaluated. The review outlined appropriate physical (i.e., photometric)
    and self-report (e.g., preferences) approaches for data collection in context
    and potential articulations between them. Mixed data collection and data analysis
    techniques are deemed essential to articulate lighting design strategies engaging
    with the requirements of hospital occupants on a 24-hour basis.
