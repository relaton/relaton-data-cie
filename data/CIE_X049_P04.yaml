abstract:
- content: The performance of the TLM measurement instrument plays important roles
    in the measurement results and uncertainties. To characterize a TLM measurement
    instrument, some indices and relevant measurement procedures can be learned from
    current CIE publications for photometers measuring time-averaged luminous quantities.
    However, as the fast and time resolved photometric data is captured, other more
    characteristics of TLM measurement instrument need to be addressed. In this paper,
    the characterization linearity, frequency response and noise properties and their
    of the TLM measurement instrument was studied. Considering the actual application,
    quality indices were proposed based on traditional appraising metrics, and the
    measurement procedures were developed correspondingly. Furthermore, several TLM
    measurement instruments were measured, and the results showed fine applicability
    of these quality indices.
