- content: |-
    CIE 236:2019 concerns lighting for roads where pedestrians are the primary road user. Lighting guides recommend certain criteria for design such as target illuminances. The bases of these recommendations are, however, largely unstated or were not published in international magazines and got lost. The aim of this report is therefore to provide a summary of credible, empirical evidence of the effects of changes in lighting on the visual impressions and visual performance of pedestrians, as a basis for future revisions to design standards.
    The publication is written in English, with a short summary in French and German.
