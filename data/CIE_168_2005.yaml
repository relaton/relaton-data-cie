    The CIE TC 8-05 terms of reference include defining a "minimal set of standard colour spaces that addresses a wide range of imaging applications". One set of applications that was identified by the committee required the use of extended-gamut colour encodings. This document defines a set of objective metrics for evaluating the characteristics of output-referred extended-gamut colour encodings. Detailed metrics have been developed to evaluate a number of important attributes of extended-gamut colour encodings. These criteria include:

    The relative importance of the individual metrics will vary on an application-by-application basis. As a result, the committee concluded that the actual evaluation of candidate colour encodings for use in particular applications should be left to other standards bodies that are more closely aligned with the relevant industry segments, and therefore would be better able to define the appropriate application-dependent requirements.

    The report is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It consists of 68 pages with 61 figures and 18 tables.
