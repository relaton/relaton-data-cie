abstract:
- content: 'A pilot study was carried out to explore the shading effect brought by
    opaque solar panel with four different layouts on the quantity of daylighting
    in greenhouse. Semi-physical simulations using mock-ups have been performed in
    a 15-metre-diametre heliodon system. The shading effect of four layouts were studied
    on equinox day at latitude 40Â° at 20 measuring points in an interval of 30 minutes.
    Illuminances were collected as raw data to obtain daylight factors. The results
    suggested that daylight factors of the ''horizontal'' layout are significantly
    lower. It was also found that the direct sunlight illuminated on the first two
    rows is significantly lower than the other two rows in all four layouts. An initial
    conclusion can be drawn from the results of this pilot study: ''horizontal'' layout
    of PV panels should be avoided to enable better lighting for plants when integrated
    with greenhouse.'
