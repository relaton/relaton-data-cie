abstract:
- content: We propose a measure of temporal light quality that could be used to design
    flicker-free light sources, as perceived by birds. It can be applied to, among
    others, the poultry industry to reduce the negative impact of the modulated light
    on chicken health and well-being. The model is built by modifying an existing
    human flicker visibility model considering properties of bird vision. We discuss
    the implications of the model responses on the temporal quality of relevant historical
    light sources.
