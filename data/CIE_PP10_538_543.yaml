abstract:
- content: An integrating sphere photometer was characterized for the luminous flux
    measurements of solid-state lighting panels. Relative angular intensity distributions
    of six OLED panels with dimensions under 10 cm were measured with a near-field
    goniospectrometer and the integrating sphere was scanned both photometrically
    and spectrally with a commercial sphere scanner. The correction factors for the
    integrating sphere photometer, including the photometric and spectral spatial
    corrections, were calculated for the tested panels. The corrected luminous flux
    values of the OLEDs, measured in the integrating sphere, were at best within 0,02
    % between horizontal and vertical operating orientations. The expanded uncertainty
    (k = 2) of the SSL panel measurements in the integrating sphere photometer is
    1,0 %.
