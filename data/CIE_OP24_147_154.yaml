abstract:
- content: The loss of visual attention is one important reason of traffic accidents
    during the night. This paper explores the variations of brain activity as subjects
    recognizing different visual targets in mesopic vision. The impact of contrast
    and eccentricity of visual target on ERP signal, detection rate and reaction time
    is investigated. Results indicate that the influence of contrast on amplitude
    and latency of P300 component is significant, as well as the detection rate and
    reaction time. The peak amplitude of P300 component increases and latency of P300
    component shortens when contrast increases. The detection rate increases, and
    reaction time decreases when contrast increases. The influence of eccentricity
    within 4Â° visual angle is not significant on all the items.
