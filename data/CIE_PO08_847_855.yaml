abstract:
- content: When illuminating paintings with WLED in museum, should not only consider
    the lowest illumination damage, but also meet the viewing requirements. Lower
    the damage of illumination on paintings must based on the requirements of viewing.
    Ten kinds of WLED spectral power distribution were chosen and the colour rendering
    index of them were calculated to verify if they meet the colour rendering requirements.
    Comprehensive relative impact index of SPDs on three kinds of Chinese light colour
    paintings were calculated and obtain the characteristics of low damage light sources
    which meet the colour rendering requirements. Low damage and high colour rendering
    light sources can be realized, provided theoretical support for the construction
    of the lowest damage WLED spectrum for painting illumination that can meet the
    viewing requirements.
