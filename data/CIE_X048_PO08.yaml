abstract:
- content: It is necessary for making the real appearance of human skin sample to
    deal with not only the spectral reflectance characteristics but also the multi-layer
    structure and translucency. This paper reported the measurement and analysis of
    the spectral transmitted and scattering light characteristics. For five subjects,
    the maximum of transmitted light intensity was resulted at 700 nm near the light
    source, and decreased with decreasing wavelength. Longer the wavelength, longer
    the distance which the transmitted light intensity was downing to zero. we defined
    the average attenuation ratio per unit transmitted light intensity which had the
    calculation range from 3.5 mm from the light source to the distance that the variation
    ratio of the transmitted light intensity per unit distance was converged to zero.
    All subjects results showed the peak of the average attenuation ratio at 700 nm
    and the value were almost 0.5. And they decreased with decreasing wavelength.
