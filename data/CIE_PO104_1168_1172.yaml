abstract:
- content: Following the strategy in a previous work, we have evaluated the potential
    Blue -Light Hazard (BLH) of high colour rendering index LED sources, on people
    whose crystalline lenses have been removed through a surgical procedure to implant
    intraocul ar lenses. Starting from the spectral transmittance of various models
    of commercial intraocular lenses (IOLs), modifications of the action spectrum
    for the BLH photo biological effect are proposed for each type of IOL. Then, using
    the corrected action spec tra, the potential hazard of different types of white
    LED sources on subjects implanted with those IOLs, as compared to the potential
    hazard of the same sources for a person whose crystalline lens has not been removed,
    has been calculated.
