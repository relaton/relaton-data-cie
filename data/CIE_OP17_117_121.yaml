abstract:
- content: This paper aims to investigate the performances of different gamut mapping
    algorithms (GMAs) based on two uniform colour spaces (UCSs), CAM16-UCS and HDR-UCS.
    Two new GMAs were proposed here and they were compared the other different GMAs.
    Experimental results showed that a newly proposed GMAs based on vividness perception
    performed well and HDR-UCS is a promising UCS for gamut mapping.
