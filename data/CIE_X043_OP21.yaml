abstract:
- content: When evaluating the daylight factor in buildings, generally an exponential
    decline of the illuminance is perceived the further the distance from the window.
    A better daylight penetration should be put forward, for example by redirecting
    a part of the light to the ceiling. The goal of this study was to investigate
    the optical characteristics of readily available patterned glazing to this use.
    Besides an assessment of the total reflectance and transmittance properties, bidirectional
    transmittance distribution function measurements under multiple angles of illumination
    were performed on a set of glazing samples. The resulting BTDF data were combined
    and transformed into an appropriate format for implementation in light simulation
    software. In result, daylight simulations of buildings can be performed with accurate
    input data. As an example, the implementation of a characterized glazing sample
    in a public office is presented.
