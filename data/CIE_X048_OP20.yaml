abstract:
- content: 'Glare assessments are currently made from High Dynamic Range (HDR) images
    taken from the Point Of View (POV) and viewing direction of a user. This paper
    analyses the feasibility to estimate the Daylight Glare Probability (DGP) at the
    user-level based on machine-learning techniques, sun position and a downward-pointing
    camera sensor mounted at the ceiling of a simulated office environment. Three
    different office cases have been considered: an empty room, an empty room with
    venetian blinds and a furnished room without venetian blinds. The influence of
    the sun direction has been considered as a parameter to predict the observer DGP.
    Subsequently, the best parameters have been selected to build a black box model
    using Artificial Intelligence (AI). Results show that, by using the DGP of the
    ceiling camera and the sun position, it is possible to accurately predict the
    DGP for an observers POV.'
