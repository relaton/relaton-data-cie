abstract:
- content: For further efforts in saving energy in lighting installations, intelligent
    sensors are indispensable. Despite the fact such sensors are available precise
    and reproducible measurements of the coverage areas are missing. Therefore, METAS
    decided in 2020 to install the world's first manufacturer-independent fully automated
    measurement system to test passive infrared motion and presence sensors according
    to the recently published standard IEC 63180:2020. The test facility allows reproducible
    measurements of radial and tangential movements by moving different scaled and
    heated dummies on linear tracks. Furthermore, the presence detection can be measured
    with an automated robot arm. The test results are provided in a digital test report
    and the data is available in a machine-readable format to be further processed
    in designing and planning softwares.
