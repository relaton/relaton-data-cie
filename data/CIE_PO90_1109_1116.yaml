abstract:
  content: Two psychophysical experiments were carried out in this study. The first
    experiment was conducted in a real road where an LED road sign was set up under
    two types of street lamps. Observers were asked to assess the visibility of an
    LED road direction sign placed on the road. And the second experiment was a computer
    simulation experiment, conducted using 130 simulated images as the stimuli presented
    on computer monitor situated in a darkened room. The experimental results show
    that the closer the sign was to the observers, the more visible the sign tended
    to appear. In addition, the higher the luminance contrast was for the sign, the
    more visible the sign tended to appear.
