- content: In order to reveal the preferable lighting conditions for the improvement
    of appearance of women's facial skin with cosmetic foundation, we conducted a
    subjective experiment under some lighting conditions. Before the experiment, we
    set up the lighting conditions using a programmable light source that enables
    to create arbitrary spectral distributions. Next, we measured the skin colour
    of the face of a female model, using a 2D colorimeter under 78 lighting conditions.
    Measured chromaticity values of the women's face were transformed into their RGB
    values using the calibration data of a display. Twenty female participants observed
    the cheeks of the face of the woman and evaluated the "naturalness", "activity",
    "sophistication", "health", "familiarity" and "preference". As a result, it was
    revealed that facial skin with make-up does not look preferable under lighting
    conditions in which spectral components of 528-562nm are included, suggesting
    that the control of middle wavelength components should be critical for improving
    appearance of woman's facial skin with cosmetic foundation.
