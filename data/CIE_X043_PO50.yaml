abstract:
- content: We have evaluated the spatial dependent colorimetric parameters on a LED
    lighted expressway and an experimental road by both in-field measurements and
    simulations. Based on the theory of multivariate normal distribution, we have
    defined the chromaticity difference du'v' and corresponding ellipse to analyse
    the measured and simulated results. The du'v' is successively influenced by model,
    distance, and height of the luminaires. The highly correlated colour rendering
    indexes of CRI and CQS are above 70 for all measurements. These practical results
    were expected to provide as references for the design and construction of LED
    lighted roads.
