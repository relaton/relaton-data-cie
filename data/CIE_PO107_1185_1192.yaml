abstract:
- content: The using of special protective clothes for dangerous environment expects
    the determination of limits their safety and reliability. One of possibility of
    evaluation of barrier properties these protective clothes are testing during acting
    model gas. Present method of evaluation is based on system local passive dosimeters.
    This method described above is very complicated and work-intensive (evaluation
    of the dosimeters by gas chromatography). Also, this method does not make possible
    accurate localization of the penetration place trough barrier textile. Therefore,
    was developed method at the National Authority for Nuclear, Biological and Chemical
    Protection Czech Republic, which makes possible the indication of penetration
    by the concrete place thanks the colour change of special underwear textile after
    reaction with acceptable indicator. This colour change allows quantitative evaluation
    of quantity of penetrated gas. Quantity is same as intensity of colour change
    as well as area of place where is colour change located. Penetrating gas has the
    most intensive reaction in area concrete penetration. Thanks, the diffusion and
    flow is his trace step by step feathered so that there are the new areas with
    progressive growing down of colour change intensity. The areas with growing down
    of colour change intensity are bigger than areas indicating concrete area of penetration.
    In past time the method of evaluation was based on the visual comparison colour
    changes by etalons done with the same material as underwear textile, which was
    exposed different gas dose (Dose is product c x t, that mean the influence of
    gas with concentration c during the time t on the etalon). This evaluation is
    relatively successful for approximate estimation of total penetration, but thanks
    the considerable incorrectness and subjectivity is non-acceptable for comparative
    determination and required correlations for extra dangerous substances. From these
    reasons was sought system of objective evaluation, which would safe advantages
    of single valued, prompt and area identification by the mean of colour change.
