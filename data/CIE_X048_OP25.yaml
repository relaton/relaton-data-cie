abstract:
- content: In order to examine the effect of the translucent level of each layer on
    the visual privacy and the view when the window equipment is divided into three
    sections, the subject experiment was carried out. It was found that visibility
    from inside and estimated visibility from outside were proportional to each other
    regardless of the window equipment condition. The relationship between visibility
    from inside and estimated visibility from outside was affected by the shielding
    position of the window equipment, and it was revealed that the clearer the view
    from the middle layer, the more privacy could be secured. In addition, it was
    suggested that opening the lower level of the window rather than the upper level
    would ensure both privacy and view.
