- content: |-
    The nonvisual biological and behavioural effects of light in animals and humans are
    mediated by specific neuroanatomical pathways. Controlled empirical studies have
    shown that light can be used to treat some clinical disorders and may have broader,
    nonclinical applications for problems of shift work and jet lag. Studies are testing how
    lighting may be incorporated into architectural designs that are optimal for vision as
    well as physiological and behavioural stimulation.
