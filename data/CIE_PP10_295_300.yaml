abstract:
- content: In this research, we proposed an illumination method focused on the safety
    and visibility of the stairs, and the main purpose is to verify the performance
    mainly of the elderly. Based on the results of the experiment, it is thought that
    the impression of the space can be enhanced by the illumination method that lightens
    the step part of the stair even in the environment of similar illuminance. In
    particular, it is considered that "glare" and "uneven illuminance distribution"
    can be improved by installing "handrail lighting". Such "handrail illumination"
    is considered to be applicable when there is no ceiling when the ceiling height
    is very low or very high, and the installation position of the lighting is limited.
    Moreover, by utilizing the line light source illuminating the wall surface, it
    is considered that the light environment becomes more even and safe.
