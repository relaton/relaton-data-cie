abstract:
- content: 'While physical gloss exists as a physically measurable index, people perceive
    a perceptual gloss as gloss on object surfaces. However, the physical gloss does
    not always match the perceptual gloss. Thus, we analysed the relationship between
    physical features and perceptual gloss by measuring the physical properties of
    object surfaces, including physical gloss. For the experiment, we prepared 127
    samples of flat objects that consisted of three materials: paper, resin, and metal
    plating. Perceptual gloss was visually evaluated using a magnitude estimation
    method. Plural measurements were conducted to obtain physical features such as
    gloss unit, haze, distinctness of image (DOI), luminance image features, and transmittance
    of the samples. Then, we constructed a prediction model of perceptual gloss using
    these physical features and perceptual gloss through multiple regression analysis.
    As a result, the prediction accuracy was improved by combining multiple physical
    quantities with simple regression, using only a gloss unit.'
