abstract:
- content: LED lighting solutions sometimes give rise to optical flicker. In most
    cases, the temporal modulations are too fast to be perceived directly, but may
    still be noticed through stroboscopic effects. We report on an investigation on
    how people experience the lighting in an office where two LED lamps are modulated
    separately with different frequencies. The test subjects performed tasks for evaluation
    of perception, attention and reaction time. The subjects are found to be affected
    by the modulated light as the reaction times are shorter and the attention test
    scores are higher in modulated lighting compared to constant lighting. Furthermore,
    the study confirms that the stroboscopic effect depends on the nature of the tasks
    and that it is more easily perceived at lower frequencies but noticed up to at
    least 400 Hz.
