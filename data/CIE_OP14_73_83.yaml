abstract:
- content: This experiment was carried out in an aircraft cab. Six high-power LED
    floodlights were used to produce five different ambient lighting conditions. The
    observers completed visual tasks on a display, which was set at five different
    luminance levels under each ambient lighting condition. Thus, each observer completed
    the visual tasks under 25 combinations (filter out 2 conditions) of display luminance
    and ambient lighting conditions, with five in each trial, with a goal to avoid
    the visual fatigue caused by the long experiment. For each combination, the observer
    performed the work performance test, visual fatigue test, and a questionnaire
    to rate the level of visual fatigue and visual comfort. Electro-oculogram (EOG)
    data was collected throughout the experiment, the Critical Fusion Frequency (CFF)
    test and the Near Point Accommodation (NPA) test was performed before starting
    the visual task to evaluate the level of visual fatigue. The observers were asked
    to read the Ann Fermo J correction table. The hit rate, the false alarm rate,
    and the duration of the reading were recorded. When the observers completed the
    task, the CFF and NPA was carried out again. The difference of them before and
    after the visual task and characterize the visual fatigue. At the end, the observers
    completed a questionnaire to rate their level of fatigue and visual comfort. Primary
    Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to evaluate the visual fatigue between four
    methods. According to the pilot questionnaire to determine the weight of performance,
    visual fatigue and visual comfort. As a conclusion the dimming curve was derived
    to illustrate the Optotype luminance level of the display under each ambient lighting
    condition.
