abstract:
- content: 'The construction of large and medium-sized public buildings in cities
    shows an accelerated trend of development with an increasing share of the total.
    As the core of large-scale public buildings, the space of the atrium rises in
    abundance of space forms and spaces, at the same time, it also exposes the problems
    of poor comfort and high energy consumption in space and physical environment.
    This article is carried out in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region for largescale
    public buildings and the physical environment of the atrium of the subjective
    and objective investigation of the user''s comfort feelings. "For all building
    needs, it is not a panacea, but for many purposes, it is considered to be a better
    way of understanding comparing to any part of the modern architectural forms."
    The English architecture theorist Richard Saxon''s discussion of the atrium space
    directly expressed the praise and affirmation of the atrium space. The construction
    of the city and the construction of large public buildings also show the trend
    of accelerating development. It is not only promoting the economic and social
    development, but also enhancing the function of the urban residents'' production
    and living service.  The atrium space is the most important core area in the public
    architecture, reflecting the architectural features and creativity: the field
    that architects can play the most imaginative. It also bears the functions of
    public building''s traffic, aggregation, communication, culture and economy. Also,
    the atrium is an essential part of public buildings. One of the characteristics
    of large public buildings is the high energy consumption, according to a Tsinghua
    University survey of all kinds of buildings. The results show that the power consumption
    of large public buildings heating is 1.5~6 times of ordinary residential or general
    public buildings; at present, a large area of public buildings is less than 10
    % of the total area of the building, but the total energy consumption (excluding
    heating) are more than the total energy consumption of buildings (except in the
    30 % heating). The proportion of the total energy consumption of the building
    is higher, because of its large space scale, large flow of personnel, open etc.
    The research value of atrium space is very valuable, both from the experience
    of space and the comfort of comprehensive physical environment such as energy
    saving. Currently, the research of atrium space and physical environment of large
    public buildings around the world is relatively mature. However, the integration
    of disciplines and the influence of physical environment assessment on architectural
    design is still at the beginning status. In the research: the significance of
    the study is on the 20 physical environment of atrium in large public building
    from a comprehensive perspective of early data collation, promoting the research
    of establishment of basic technical data for later established simulation study
    provides guidance parameter foundation model. This study mainly involves two parts:
    subjective and objective. The objective investigation mainly focuses on the large-scale
    public buildings with typical  atrium space and large scale. The atrium interior
    space scale, illumination, brightness, wind speed, temperature and humidity and
    decorative materials reflectance data for a unified time measurement and simultaneous
    measurement of the outdoor environment at the same time. Through the collation
    of measurement data and comparison   with related standards, the typical atrium
    space model and the physical environment of the main reference parameters and
    illumination, brightness distribution and temperature and humidity changes. Subjective
    survey, users include staff and visitors, the questionnaire includes the atrium
    intuitive perception of space and the atrium acoustic environment, light environment,
    thermal comfort and subjective evaluation and make recommendations. Finally, 527
    effective questionnaires were obtained. The results of the questionnaire showed
    that 87 % of the respondents gave two very good and particularly good evaluations
    on the spatial scale morphology, mainly on the degree of quietness in the acoustic
    environment of the atrium and whether the external noise is shielded Brightness
    and softness in the environment and the degree of hot and cold in the hot environment
    and the air circulation have a higher concern.'
