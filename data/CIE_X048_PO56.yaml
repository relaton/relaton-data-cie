abstract:
- content: Daylight attributes to the aggregate of direct and indirect lights originating
    from the sun during the daytime. Integrating daylight with electrical lighting
    can serve as a means to lessen electricity costs for buildings. Geographic location
    and weather conditions facilitate most of the areas of Nepal to receive on average
    12 hours of daylight and have huge energy-saving potential. However, the integration
    of daylight has not been admitted in the building code of Nepal. Moreover, contemporary
    architectural design lacks employment of techniques illustrated by illumination
    engineering to integrate daylight. This study analyses the plausibility and benefits
    of integrating daylight with electric light for a typical commercial building
    of Nepal employing the DIALux model and simulation. Simulation integrating energy-efficient
    electric light and daylight was done to observe illumination levels and light
    power density. For daylight performance, year-round conditions were observed for
    three different sky types. Modification of building architecture to integrate
    daylighting components was also studied. In the later part of the study, analysis
    was done to observe energy-saving potential and financial benefits. Results designated
    the plausibility of blending daylight with electrical lighting in the building
    for all-sky conditions. Extensive energy thrift was observed and was higher with
    added daylight components. Recommendations of the study to blend light sources
    and incorporation of daylight components are attainable with current technology
    and trend in Nepal with accompanying benefits of energy-saving, reduced operation,
    and reduced maintenance cost.
