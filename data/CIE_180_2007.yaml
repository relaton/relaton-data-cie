    The great majority of the deaths from road accidents happen in the less-motorised
    developing regions of the world, particularly Asia - and the absolute numbers are
    growing. As in the highly motorised countries of the world, a significant proportion of
    accidents occur at night. This report deals with the part that better lighting and
    visibility can play in reducing the toll of death and injury; it is addressed to those
    involved in road safety work, not to lighting specialists. Its basic intentions are to
    guide, inform and encourage.

    The report starts by explaining the basic "language of light" and defining the
    terms and quantities it uses. The night-time value of simple road markings and signs
    is then explained, stressing the importance of retroreflective materials. This leads to
    the role of vehicle lighting, with particular emphasis on the need for individual drivers
    to take responsibility for cleaning and aiming. A chapter on fixed roadway lighting
    deals with the basic design of simple installations and explains the many different
    factors that need to be considered. Because of its importance, maintenance is
    considered in a separate chapter. Finally, there is some general lighting-related
    material for use in road safety campaigns.

    A consistent message of the report is that it is worth doing something rather
    than nothing, as long as it is done intelligently and with an understanding of the basic
    principles involved.

    The report is written in English, with a short summary in French and German. It
    consists of 47 pages with 36 figures and 12 tables.
