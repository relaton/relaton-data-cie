abstract:
- content: For the calculation of the photometric parameters of the road lighting
    are needed photometric data of the used luminaires. These data are in the form
    of an intensity table (I-table) which gives the distribution of luminous intensity
    emitted by the luminaire in all relevant directions. A goniophotometer is needed
    to measure the luminous intensity distribution of luminaires. We know the various
    goniophotometers which adopting different test methods for testing luminous distribution.
    The results from goniophotometric measurements are very important for lighting
    engineers who are using these results in lighting calculation of photometric parameters
    of the various lighting systems. Especially in road lighting calculation distance
    between angles should be measured as much as possible providing sufficient photometric
    data for the calculation. Some new optical systems and some LED luminaires which
    as found by measurement may contain various local extremes in the luminous intensity
    distribution curve.
