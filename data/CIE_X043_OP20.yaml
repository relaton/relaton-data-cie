abstract:
- content: A study was carried out to investigate the spectra of a light source affecting
    the texture perceptions. A method was developed on the enhancement of visibility
    of textures and was verified via two psychophysical experiments on images displayed
    on a monitor and real materials in a viewing cabinet. Three wavelength regions
    at around 425 nm, 480 nm - 505 nm and 660 nm were found to form a white illuminant
    that can largely improve the visibility of texture. The visual results showed
    the effectiveness of the spectra design method. Also, the results obtained from
    the display and viewing cabinets gave similar results.
