abstract:
- content: This article presents a series of quantitative research on the relationship
    between office lighting environment and office employees? psychological and physical
    discomfort based on a full-scale survey of 842 working people in Beijing. The
    results show that working people?s psychological assessment is significantly relevant
    to office lighting environment; however, little clear links can be found between
    physical assessment and office lighting environment. Sleep quality is relevant
    to office lighting environment in the daytime. Warmer, brighter and more satisfying
    natural lighting environment helps to improve sleep quality.
