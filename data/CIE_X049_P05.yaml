abstract:
- content: 'Lock-in detection is a well-established technique to measure the amplitude
    and phase of a modulated signal in the presence of noise, background, and parasitic
    signals. This technique is commonly used in many applications to extract small,
    modulated signals buried in noise that could not directly be measured otherwise.In
    most lighting products, temporal light modulation is usually a periodic fluctuation
    of the light output resulting from the power supply. Lock-in detection is inherently
    well-suited to the characterisation of these optical oscillations superimposed
    to a large luminous background.Different methods of lock-in detection are applicable
    to photometric and spectroradiometric measurements in the presence of temporal
    light modulation: electrical lock-in detection with a lock-in amplifier, digital
    lock-in detection based on synchronous sampling, and purely optical lock-in detection.The
    practical implementations of these methods are detailed, illustrated, and compared.
    Their respective advantages and drawbacks are presented in the case of photometric
    and in the case of more complex measurements based on array spectrometers and
    imaging photometric instruments. New applications enabled by temporal light modulation
    are given.'
