abstract:
- content: The aim of this study is to develop an intelligent lighting system applying
    in museums. A multi-LED system is used to produce reference source and test sources.
    Four factors in the multi-LED system were manipulated, which were predominant-hue
    emphasizing spectrum, vividnesseffect spectrum, sample pattern, and sample colour
    combination. The results indicated when the illuminants with the special SPDs
    illuminate on textile samples, the colour-vividness effect of the textiles can
    be emphasized. It is concluded when an observer watches the textile samples under
    the illuminant with colour-vividness effect, then subjects can feel vivid, pleasant,
    as well as clear simultaneously.
