abstract:
- content: Currently, programs for lighting calculation based on computer graphics
    (CG) allows us to move to a fundamentally new approach to a assessing the quality
    of lighting. A designing based on illuminance can be complement with designing
    based on synthetic images or on lighting design. Modern CG programs can calculate
    the spatial-angular distribution of luminance (SADL). However, to make the assessment
    of the quality of lighting using SADL a new criterion is needed. This paper considers
    constructing a physiological model of the visual perception scale based on experimental
    data and on neural network for simple scene as light source viewed on a uniform
    background with different luminance levels.  Scale based on threshold contrasts
    of luminance for each sensation can be a fundament of new criterion. The article
    offers the method of construction the map for each sensation using the example
    of «discomfort» and «unpleasant» maps that can easily applied in programs.
