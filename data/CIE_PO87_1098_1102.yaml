abstract:
- content: IWe have developed a method based on on-site measurement of luminance images
    to study the reflected properties of LED and HPS lighted wet road. The distance
    of imaging luminance measurement device (ILMD) can be very close to the measured
    region to have high observation angles. All the measured luminance images were
    analysed and summarized to a distribution of reflected luminance as a function
    deviation angle, incidence angle, and observation angle.
