abstract:
- content: Our study shows the extent to which the complexity of the light field has
    an influence on shape perception. It is hypothesized that more complex light fields
    are associated with a larger error in shape perception. Due to LED technology
    and the use of LED arrays, light fields are becoming increasingly complex. From
    shape-from-shading experiments it is known that the visual system must make assumptions
    about the light field and the light direction to perceive the form correctly.
    The results show that complex light fields from LED arrays can lead to a distorted
    perception of shape, whereas simple directional or diffuse light fields enhance
    shape perception.
