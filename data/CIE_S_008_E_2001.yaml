    CIE published its "Guide on interior lighting" 2nd edition in 1986. Since then lighting practice
    changed considerably, and it became necessary to prepare a new guide, this time as a CIE
    Standard.
    Good lighting requires equal attention to the quantity and quality of the lighting. While
    the provision of sufficient illuminance on the task is necessary, in many instances the visibility
    depends on the way in which the light is applied, the colour characteristics of the light source
    and surfaces together with the amount of glare the system gives. In this standard opportunity
    was taken to specify for various work places and task types not just the illuminance but also
    the limiting discomfort glare and minimum colour rendering index of the source. Parameters to
    create comfortable visual conditions are proposed in the body of this standard. The
    recommended values are considered to represent a reasonable balance, having regard to the
    requirements for safe, healthy and efficient work performance. The values can be achieved
    with practical energy efficient solutions.
    There are also visual ergonomic parameters such as perceptual ability and the
    characteristics and attributes of the task, which determine the quality of the operator's visual
    skills, and hence performance levels. In some cases enhancement of these influencing
    factors can improve performance without the need to raise illuminance. For example by
    improving the contrast of the task attributes, enlarging the task by the use of up to date visual
    aids (glasses) and by the provision of special lighting systems with local directional lighting
    capability.
    The Standard provides guidance for illuminance, glare limitation and colour quality for
    general building areas, agriculture buildings, the cement, concrete and brick industry, ceramic
    and glass industry, chemical, plastics and rubber industry, electrical industry, food industry,
    foundries and metal casting plants, hairdresser, jewelry manufacturing, laundries and dry
    cleaning, leather industry, metal working and processing, paper industry, power stations,
    printers, iron and steel works, textile industry, vehicle construction, wood working and
    furniture industry, offices, retailing, restaurants and hotels, places of entertainment, libraries,
    indoor public car parks, educational buildings, health care premises, airports, and churches.
