abstract:
- content: Pedestrians and motorcyclists are vulnerable road users, being over represented
    in road traffic collisions (RTCs). One assumed benefit of road lighting is a reduction
    in RTCs after dark by countering the impairment to the visual detection of hazards
    that occur after dark. One way to optimise the use of road lighting is to light
    only those sections of road where light level, and hence visibility, is an important
    factor. The current study used change in ambient light level on RTCs to investigate
    those situations where improved vision is likely to have significant impact, and
    therefore the situations where road lighting is of better cost-benefit effectiveness.
    For both motorcyclist and pedestrian RTCs there was a significant increase in
    overall RTC risk in darkness compared to daylight, indicating that there may be
    an overall benefit of road lighting. While darkness was a particular detriment
    at junctions for motorcyclists and on high-speed roads for pedestrians, road lighting
    may not be effective mitigation in either case and therefore alternative ways
    of increasing conspicuity should be considered.Â
