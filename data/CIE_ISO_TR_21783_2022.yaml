abstract:
- content: This Technical Report is prepared by ISO/TC 274, Light and lighting in
    cooperation with the International Commission on Illumination (CIE).The content
    of this document represents the state of the art at the date of publication and
    it is not necessarily complete.At present ipRGC-influenced responses to light
    (IIL responses) are often referred to as non-image-forming (NIF) or non-visual
    (NV) responses to reflect their distinction from perceptual vision. This document
    reflects that interest while allowing for the possibility for the accepted range
    of light responses driven by ipRGCs to expand as we gain more knowledge.The light
    patterns of exposure can be beneficial or non-beneficial for humans depending
    on the setting, relating to spectrum, intensity, duration, and timing of the resulting
    light exposure.This document provides an analysis and evaluation of the current
    state of the art with regard to ipRGC-influenced responses to light in applying
    this knowledge in the context of identified topics to be considered for use in
    lighting applications. This analysis has taken into consideration published scientific
    papers, use cases, reports, best-practice guidelines and recommendations, see
    Annex A. However, evaluation of the results will be based on scientifically validated
    findings.
